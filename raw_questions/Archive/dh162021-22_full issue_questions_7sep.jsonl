It can be seen as an integrated approach that comprises four elements - People, Process, Methods and\nPrinciples. User Experience (UX) encompasses all aspects of the end-user\u2019s interactions with an organisation, its services\nand products. In DSTA, DI and UX are combined for strategic impact and organisational transformation while enhancing\nuser experience and satisfaction in the solutions it creates for defence and national security. This article describes the\nimportance of DI and UX (collectively referred to as DI-UX) and discusses its application in the organisation and the design\nof an integrated Command, Control and Communication System.\n\nKeywords: design innovation, transformation strategy, design methodology, user experience, user-centric design\n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWe live in a world that is perpetually changing, one that is\nfraught with complex challenges and uncertainties. The ever-\nevolving threat landscape and technological climate today\nmeans that the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) will need to\nrapidly innovate and transform the way in which wars are\nfought in the digital age to maintain a technology edge over\nits adversaries.\n\nSingapore\u2019s declining citizen population is another immutable\nchallenge that the SAF will need to tackle. With up to 30%\nfewer National Servicemen by 2030 (Ng, 2016), any technology\ndeveloped for the SAF must not only be manpower-efficient,\nbut also intuitive to use.\n\nThe need for enhanced user experience (UX) in our solutions is\neven more important as the younger generation of SAF soldiers\nare accustomed to the latest technology and interactive\ndevices. As leading consumers of technology in the future\n(Ostermeier, 2021), UX can no longer be an afterthought, but\nwill be an increasing necessity in military solutions.\n\n4 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\nTHE DSTA DESIGN JOURNEY\n\nAs a statutory board under the Ministry of Defence, DSTA\nis responsible for delivering technological solutions to the\nSAF. The nature of work in DSTA spans a wide spectrum to\nensure that the SAF continues to be a formidable fighting\nforce. In light of the changing threat landscape and increasing\nexpectations for superior UX in our solutions, DSTA has\ninvested heavily in developing Design Innovation (Dl) and UX\ncapabilities since 2015.\n\nThe goal of Dl is to tackle complex problems using the mindset\nand approach of a designer. It is a user-centric methodology for\nsystematic innovation, and aims to find the right solutions that\nwill create the desired results for the right problem. DI acts as\na Catalyst to effect innovative, user-centric and future-oriented\nthinking to drive enterprise-level transformation. It emphasises\nempathy, which is a key skill to enable deep understanding of\nusers, opens up opportunities in their business objectives and\nmissions, and consequently informs how technologies can be\nbetter designed to deliver real value and impact.\n\fUX aims to create frictionless and desirable experience in all\naspects of the end-user\u2019s interaction with products, services\nand systems. The increase in expectations for good UX and the\ngradual reduction of manpower has driven the need for DSTA\nto raise the bar of design quality. Together, DI and UX design\naims to deliver impactful solutions with delightful experience.\n\nSeeding the DI Culture"}

QUESTION : {Model to insert question}, \nANSWER: {Model to insert answer} \nText :\nSeeding the DI Culture\n\nDSTA began seeding a culture of DI within the organisation with\na series of initiatives to equip staff with DI knowledge and skills\nthrough a strategic partnership with the Singapore University\nof Technology and Design (SUTD), more specifically, the\nSUTD-MIT International Design Centre (IDC). The partnership\n(DesignSingapore Council, 2020) resulted in a bespoke DI\nCourse co-designed by both partners to train DSTA engineers\nwith DI skills simultaneously while working on high priority\nprojects. Depending on the area of application, DI course\noutcomes typically ranged from solution proposals in the form\nof digital products, to policy changes and services provided.\n\nWith its commencement in 2015, the DI course focused\non two key objectives: (1) to develop engineers with\nfoundational DI mindsets, principles and methods; and (2)\nto enhance understanding through application of DI on real\ntopics and projects. This collaboration combined DSTA\u2019s\nstrength in systems engineering and SUTD-IDC\u2019s expertise\nin taking a human-centred multidisciplinary approach to\nengineering design.\n\nDesigning the DI Course\n\nDuration, Format and Structure\n\nEvery run of the course conducted was improved from the\npreceding run based on participant feedback. Beginning with\na two-day workshop that grew into a three-day bootcamp,\nthe course duration was eventually expanded from 12 to 15\nweeks and incorporated multiple opportunities for project\nconsultation with SUTD and DSTA DI experts (e.g. framing\nworkshop to help teams frame and strategise their approach,\nsprint consultations, experiential wall reviews, etc.). At the end\nof the course, a final presentation would be made to DSTA\u2019s\nsenior management where participating teams showcased\ntheir innovations and solutions for their project topics. With\nsupport from management, the proposals for the project\nwould subsequently be pursued by the respective programme\n\ncentres (PCs), and the presentation archived as case studies\n\u2018or future sharing.\n\nTopic Curation and Team Formation\n\nThe approach to curating topics was also adjusted over the\nyears as DI maturity in the organisation grew. During the\n\u2018ormative years of the DI course, participants would scope\nout slices of their existing projects to apply DI. However,\nleading impactful change in capability development required\nexperience and expertise from multiple disciplines, thereby\ndriving the need to change how teams were formed, both in\ncomposition and in size. This resulted in a progressive elevation\nrom applying DI at a project-level to the enterprise-level,\nwhere senior leadership would take on the role as \u201cdomain\nchampions\u201d to identify crucial and high impact challenges to\nSAF and DSTA. These topics would then be undertaken by\nparticipating teams from different PCs and corporate entities,\nand in some cases, with users from the SAF.\n\n \n\nBenchmarking Progress in DI Culture\n\nOver the years, DSTA\u2019s DI strategy continuously evolved\nalongside advancements in the field, organisational needs and\nstaff feedback.\n\nA user research study was conducted in 2019 with the course\nparticipants holding appointments ranging from Engineers\nto Head Capability Development to gain insights into their\nexperience with their DI journeys. The research informed\nthat the programme provided participants with learning\nopportunities that were rare in their day-to-day work routines.\nThe exposure opened their eyes to new possibilities that would\notherwise have gone unnoticed, and allowed them to build on\none another\u2019s strengths in developing and creating innovative\nsolutions. DI provided them with a common language\nand platform for innovation and collaboration, even if they\npossessed different skills with varying experience."}

QUESTION : {Model to insert question}, \nANSWER: {Model to insert answer} \nText :\nIn 2019, DSTA also began conducting annual organisation-wide\nsurveys (Moultrie, Clarkson, & Probert, 2007) and stocktaking\nto track the impact of DI on the organisation and on staff\nthrough their project outcomes. In the most recent survey\nconducted, the results showed an increase in the organisation\ndesign maturity from an overall score of 1.97 (Level 2) before\n\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\n5\n\f\nIn the same year, DSTA also received the Singapore Good\nDesign Mark? 2019.\n\nAdvancing DI and Strengthening Culture\n\nTo date, more than 700 staff have been trained across the\norganisation \u2014 achieving a ratio of one DI Practitioner to\nfive staff. Advancing the skills and mindsets of our existing\nDI practitioners has become equally key to ensure continued\nrelevancy and impact in their work.\n\nEngagement initiatives such as Fireside Chats, Workshops\nand Seminars were started to understand ground challenges,\nadvance practitioners' knowledge in design practices\nand techniques, and promulgate lessons learnt as part of\nknowledge sharing within the organisation.\n\nDSTA has also taken a further step to establish a centralised DI-\nUX team comprising a growing pool of specialist UX Architects\nand UX Designers. The UX practitioners complement Dl-trained\nengineers and bring specialist UX design skillsets into key\nprojects. Key projects will now be supported by at least one\npair of UX Architect and UX Designer to lead in UX activities,\nwhile they work closely with Dl-trained project engineers.\n\nWith this new project teaming, DSTA conceived a DI-UX\nprocess by combining lessons learnt from various design\nwork and collaboration with leading technology companies.\nOne key aspect that differentiates the DSTA DI-UX process\nfrom general design thinking methodology is the integration\nof best practices and techniques from DI, lean UX and agile\n\n\n6 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\fNURTURING A DESIGN INNOVATION AND USER EXPERIENCE CULTURE IN DSTA\n\nCHALLENGES IN APPLICATION\n\nAs one may expect, challenges arose as DI-UX was applied\nacross the board in projects under different circumstances.\nPractitioner feedback during the DI Fireside series revealed\nthree key challenges faced across the organisation, as\nsummarised below.\n\nResource and Skillset Limitation\n\nDI can be applied in any phase of a project, and practitioners\noften find it difficult to apply DI late into the project phase,\nespecially when many other constraints had already set in.\nWhen DI efforts were not catered for early on in the project,\nmanaging project schedule, resources and scope became\nchallenging when changes needed to be made downstream.\nSome of these changes required additional effort to effect\nchange, which was difficult due to a lack of bandwidth.\nOthers required competency in specialist design areas,\nnamely UX architecting and UX design, which were lacking\namong the practitioners.\n\nGaps in Mindset\n\nFear of risk-taking and resistance to change were two of the\nmost prominent gaps in mindset raised by practitioners. For\nexample, some stakeholders sought risk-free solutions, while\nothers were unwilling to change workflows and processes.\nThis unwillingness to deviate from established norms was\nalso observed in some teams as some of them felt that they\nwere not senior enough to effect change.\n\nDesign Processes, Systems and\nInfrastructure"}

QUESTION : {Model to insert question}, \nANSWER: {Model to insert answer} \nText :\nDesign Processes, Systems and\nInfrastructure\n\nIt was observed that the full design process was usually too\ntedious to execute because of two main reasons. First, Dl\nand UX activities were mostly executed manually, generating\nphysical design artefacts in the process. Practitioners faced\nhigh barriers in digitising these artefacts due to additional\nefforts required to do so. Second, design templates or UX\npatterns were not standardised across the organisation, and\nindividuals had to create their own.\n\nInitiatives\n\nThese challenges compelled DSTA to reorganise DI-UX at\nthe organisation level. The DI-UX Team is presently exploring\nvarious ways to address challenges associated with resource\nand skillset limitation.\n\nFirst, UX support will be progressively scaled up across PCs.\nSecond, DI fireside activities will continue to be conducted to\nimbue the right mindsets and knowledge sharing to strengthen\nthe overall culture of DI among staff. This is to address the\ngeneral lack of confidence in applying DI. Third, the DI-UX Team\nhas also developed a DI Operations Playbook with templates\nto streamline design processes across the organisation. This\nwill eliminate the need for additional efforts from individual\nPCs to create separate templates. To enable consistent design\nquality and practices across the organisation, the team has\nalso built a design system containing reusable patterns for\ndigital systems.\n\nDI-UX APPLICATION IN THE\nINTEGRATED C3 SYSTEM\n\nBackground\n\nThe integrated Command, Control and Communication\n(C3) System was envisaged to be a platform for multiple\ngovernment agencies to command, control and communicate\nwhen managing and responding to incidents in large-scale\nevents, such as the Singapore's National Day Parade.\n\nDI Methodology\n\nThe team began with the discovery of the problem space\nwithin a few agencies in the public sector. User research\nwas conducted over seven months, with over 100 users\nfrom 40 operational units across four government ministries,\nto understand their respective operations, work processes\nand challenges. Research methods included user interviews,\nfocus groups, in-situ observations, ideation methods and\ndesign critiques. The research informed three key persons\ninvolved in the management of large-scale events: Decision\nMaker, Coordinating Officer and Ground Officer. To facilitate\ndeeper conversations with the users and stakeholders, several\nversions of C3 prototypes were created in varying fidelity and\nshared with them for their feedback.\n\nDiscovering and Defining the Problem\nSpace\n\nSome of the key opportunities and insights gained from the\nuser research were as follows:\n\n(1) No Access to C3 When Needed As Users Were Always\non the Move - Many of the C3 systems were housed only\n\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\f(2)\n\n(3)\n\nin operation centres at different locations. Users had to\nvisit these operation centres and log in to terminals before\nthey could access the C3 systems. This hindered users\nwho were frequently on the move.\n\nUsers Rely on WhatsApp and Emails \u2014 A number of users\ndid not have access to the C3 systems. Yet, they were still\ncalled on to contribute to the operations, and they had to\nrely on personal applications like WhatsApp and emails.\nHowever, WhatsApp was not designed for C3 operations,\nand users often became lost in the large volume of\nmessages. Sensemaking and locating relevant information\nbecame a major challenge in large-scale missions where\nmultiple groups and agencies had to work together. The\nchallenge was exacerbated by having to port information\nover to multiple applications."}

QUESTION : {Model to insert question}, \nANSWER: {Model to insert answer} \nText :\nMultiple Action Parties Lacking a Common Platform to\nFacilitate Coordination \u2014- The team observed that multiple\naction parties were involved when working on incidents.\nEven if the incident was under the jurisdiction of one\nspecific agency, people from various departments would\nhave to work together. There was no single integrated\nsystem that could be used.\n\n(4) Disparate Systems in Peace Time and Crisis Means\nMore Training is Required to Prevent Deskilling -\nAlthough users do not necessarily need to manage large-\nscale events frequently, they still needed to manage daily\noperations that required coordination and collaboration\nwith different parties. Should an incident escalate into a\nmajor event, these users would be required to be familiar\nwith their systems in order to respond quickly to the\nevent. However, users have various systems with different\noperating procedures for different types of scenarios.\nThis led to frequent training to familiarise themselves with\nsystems to prevent deskilling.\n\nDeveloping and Delivering the Proposed\nSolution\n\nSeveral versions of the prototypes were created through the\nthe key screens designed for the core functions.\n\n8 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\fNURTURING A DESIGN INNOVATION AND USER EXPERIENCE CULTURE IN DSTA\n\n\nThe prototype went through many iterations with the various\nagencies on multiple tracks of design and development. Every\nnew insight from each iteration contributed to the product\nimprovement. Based on insights gained, the team designed a\ngeneric C3 system that achieved the following goals:\n\n(1) Integrated C3 System - As mentioned earlier, users\nacross agencies did not have access to C3 systems when\nthey needed to respond to incidents, and when they did,\nthey had to work with disparate systems. Having a single\nintegrated C3 system fundamentally transformed the way\nagencies collaborated with one another by breaking down\noperational silos.\n\n(2) Significantly Quicken End-to-end Response Time\n- Using multiple systems slowed down response time\nbecause information had to be duplicated and transferred\nacross systems. All parties now accessed and worked\non the same system and used a common source of\ninformation without having to rely on personal applications\nlike WhatsApp or emails.\n\n(3) Scalable and Minimise Waste - With a generic C3\nplatform, the development teams would not need to\nrecreate the same features repeatedly in C3 systems for\neach agency. Instead, they could build on the generic\nplatform to develop bespoke functions by creating the\ndedicated applications required by different agencies. This\nhelped to streamline and minimise the overall effort.\n\nTo demonstrate how the solution worked, the team created a\nvideo storyboard depicting a counter-terrorism scenario and\nhow users should use the system to respond to the incident.\nBefore the video production started, the team created scripts\nfrom the concept video.\n\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\n9\n\fUser Feedback\n\nThe video was presented to various user groups to obtain\nfeedback on improvements, and specific applications that\nthey would need. The users were better able to articulate their\nneeds because they understood how they would coordinate\nwith other agencies, and the specific apps they would need to\nfill any operational gaps.\n\nThe users were encouraged by the design and could see\nthe value of the system. Others were excited by the new\n\n10 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\ncapabilities and potential use cases that they could apply to\ntheir own agencies.\n\nThe system went on trial during Singapore\u2019s National Day\nParade in 2019, and has since been adapted as a baseline for\n\nother C3 systems.\n\nSystem at a glance.\n\n\n\fNURTURING A DESIGN INNOVATION AND USER EXPERIENCE CULTURE IN DSTA\n\nCONCLUSION"}

These OT systems are\ncommonly found in the transport, energy, water and defence\n\nMany may not be aware that OT systems are present in\nour everyday lives and drive the way we function and work.\nHowever, these systems are not designed with cybersecurity\nin mind, as the focus is on functionality and availability. This\nmakes them attractive targets of cyberattacks, which can\ncause high mission impact, bring disruption to lives and result\nin financial losses. One of the most significant attacks was\nthe Stuxnet event, a cyberattack which caused physical and\nirreversible damage to the centrifuges in lran\u2019s nuclear plants.\n\n\n12 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\fRecognising the increasing use of cyber means to disrupt OT\nsystems, DSTA embarked on a journey to develop an approach\nto address the new needs brought about by the convergence\nof the Information Technology (IT) and OT spaces to achieve\nnew capabilities and productivity. The two key enablers to\nsecure OT were identified to be architecture standardisation\nand competency development. In the defence context, OT\ncomprises control systems on ships or aircraft, data links and\nbuilding control systems. The focus of this article is on building\ncontrol systems, which are becoming increasingly digitalised\nwith remote monitoring and control capabilities. The article\naims to describe DSTA\u2019s journey in developing the two key\nenablers, as well as identifying future efforts and priorities.\n\nWHAT ARE INDUSTRIAL CONTROL\nSYSTEMS?\n\nAn Industrial Control System (ICS) is a subset of OT systems.\nIt is a combination of control components (e.g. electrical,\nmechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic) that act together to facilitate\ndetection and maintain control of physical operations through\ndata acquisition, visualisation and controls. They play a critical\n\nrole in maintaining continuous operations, as well as ensuring\nfunctional and technical safety in the prevention of accidents\nand disasters.\n\nICS includes Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\n(SCADA)! systems, Distributed Control Systems?, and other\ncontrol system configurations such as Programmable Logic\nand connectivity of an ICS. They are typically deployed for\nmonitoring and/or the control of building related services\ndistribution such as power, water and fuel, cooling, mechanised\nequipment and physical security."}

The sensors will interpret the readings and report\nback a change of state. Actuators are used to execute the\ncontrols via a change of contact point (ON or OFF state).\nPLCs are embedded devices that are pre-programmed with\nalgorithms known as ladder logic. The role of the PLC is to\ncompare the inputs received from the sensors against a pre-\n\n\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\n13\n\fset threshold. When there are deviations, the PLC will issue the\nnecessary control signals to the actuators to bring the system\nback to the ideal state. The PLC is also the interface with the IT\nserver, and will be able to receive overriding commands from\nthe server to change the pre-set threshold. Remote Terminal\nUnits are used to interface multiple PLCs to the server, and\nhandle the interface and translation of ICS protocols, for\nexample Serial to Ethernet.\n\nInterface (HMI), servers and networking equipment to monitor\nand control the entire ICS system. The HMI is generally the\npresents information to the operator. The HMI may also accept\ncontrol instructions from the operator and sends it to the\nserver for processing. The ICS servers will poll the status of\nthe systems periodically and present the information on the\nHMI workstation. It will also receive the control instructions\nfrom the HMI and send the commands to the field device to\nactivate the control process. The Historian is the database that\nkeeps tracks of all systems status and commands for fault\ntroubleshooting purposes.\n\nEVOLUTION OF INDUSTRIAL\nCONTROL SYSTEMS\n\nEarly versions of ICS started with little automation and\ndigitalisation. Many of the control and monitoring functions\nused to be done locally with hard-wired relays and timers\ncoupled with man-in-the-loop processes. As time progressed,\nthe push for automation and enhacement to productivity led to\nthe development of remote monitoring and control capabilities.\n\nWhen these systems and capabilities were developed in the\n1970s, they were based on an air-gapped and standalone\nconcepts, with vendor or Original Equipment Manufacturer\nspecific components and protocols. The focus of the ICS\ndeveloper and users then was on availability and safety, with\nscant consideration for security. In fact, the main security\nfeature was physical security, by keeping these devices behind\nlocked gates and security guards. This has been the industry\npractice for the last 30 years.\n\nIn the early 2000s, ICS started to shift from the use of\nproprietary computing and communications to adopting\ncommon industrial standards and open protocols which made\nthem more \u201cIT-like\u201d. Yet, the mindset on how these systems\nwere used and designed did not change. Engineering teams\nmanaging these systems had little or no security awareness and\n\n14 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\ncontinued to rely on standalone designs and physical access\ncontrol measures to protect these systems.

The industry was\nalso not well prepared to support new digital models of ICS\nand was slow to apply IT security best practices. This resulted\nin fundamental security gaps and resulted in several critical\nICS becoming targets of cyberattacks.\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE\n\nThe Stuxnet malware attack which damaged the centrifuges\nin lran\u2019s nuclear plants in 2010 was a significant event and\ndemonstrated how a cyberattack could wreak havoc on ICS,\nresulting in the severe degradation of a strategic national\ncapability. Since then, there have been multiple attacks over\nthe last decade targetting ICS, with the aim of disrupting\nessential civilian services and lives.\n\nThe December 2015 Ukraine power grid cyberattack,\nwhere attackers gained control of the SCADA and remotely\nswitched off the substations, resulted in power outages for\nroughly 230,000 consumers in Ukraine. It was a wake-up\ncall for critical infrastructure operators, as networked SCADA\nsystems were already widely in use to control and monitor\nshowed the sophistication and determination of advanced\npersistent threat actors, who had carefully planned their attack\nin a stealthy and targeted manner. Using stolen credentials\nto gain remote access, changing the passwords to maintain\naccess and overwriting firmware of critical devices to deny\nremote access, the attackers disrupted the power supply to\nresidents for up to six hours in various parts of Ukraine. More\nimportantly, remote access to the substations and breakers\nwas denied for months, forcing electric grid operators to open\nand close the breakers manually, while engineers struggled to\nrestore remote management capabilities on the compromised\nPLCs. The attack emphasised the importance of securing\ncritical infrastructure, and demonstrated that threats were real\nand credible, and would significantly affect businesses and\nday-to-day livelihoods.\n\nMore recently, in 2021, the ransomware attack on the Colonial\nPipeline in the United States again demonstrated how valuable\n(as a target) and vulnerable (as a system) critical infrastructure\nsystems are. This was not a sophisticated attack yet it still\nforced the gas pipelines running from Texas to New York to\nbe shut down, resulting in fuel shortages at airports and gas\nstations. Attackers were able to gain access to the corporate\nnetwork through a legacy virtual private network used by\n\fOPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITY ROADMAP: ARCHITECTURE AND COMPETENCY AS KEY ENABLERS\n\nemployees to connect remotely into the company\u2019s computer\nnetwork, and this demonstrated how the convergence of IT and\nOT had enlarged the possible attack vectors into OT networks.\nHence, there is a need to ensure that cybersecurity measures\nfor ICS evolve with the introduction of new IT capabilites and\ntheir corresponding threats.\n\nIMPETUS TO DEVELOP ICS\nCYBERSECURITY\n\nWhat used to be standalone and physically isolated ICS\nimplementation, with a flat network architecture, minimal IT\nsecurity controls, and heavy reliance on physical controls, will\nno longer be viable in an increasingly digitalised world. Yet,\nthe distributed and proprietary ICS industry was not evolving\nfast enough and effectively to cater to the new operational\nparadigm. This resulted in the introduction of terms such as\n\u201cthe convergence of Information Technology and Operational\nTechnology\u201d and \u201cPhysical-Digital Convergence\u201d. A robust\nsolution requires more than implementing standard IT controls\nwith the vain hope that ICS systems would automatically be\nwell protected and remain functional."}

QUESTION : {Model to insert question}, \nANSWER: {Model to insert answer} \nText :\nThe Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) recognised the\ndiverse ICS landscape and published the OT Cyber Masterplan\nin 2019, with the key objective of providing guidelines\nand alignment among the OT cybersecurity industry. CSA\nwanted to create deeper awareness and understanding of\nthe cybersecurity landscape, including the challenges faced\nby OT stakeholders, and to catalyse the development of local\ncapabilities, technologies and competencies, which can aid\nCritical Information Infrastructure owners to strengthen the\ncybersecurity of their OT systems. In 2021, they also developed\nthe OT Cybersecurity Competency Framework (OTCCF) to\nguide talent and competency development in the space of OT\ncybersecurity.\n\nThe defence sector was no different, and organisations like\nDSTA had to develop a model which would meet its needs.\n\nWith the changing threat landscape, reduction in manpower\nand advancement in technology, DSTA also needed to re-\norganise, re-design and re-train to ensure defence systems\nwere always available and operational.\n\nDSTA CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT\nJOURNEY\n\nIn 2018, a small team of engineers was assembled to explore\nneed for a new way to architect and design ICS networks and\nsystems, to be ready with the increased digitalisation of ICS,\nand the corresponding increase in cyberattack surfaces. If the\nindustry was unable to develop solutions faster than the arising\nneeds, the team would need to influence the ICS community\nin the long run. This also meant that the team needed new\nperspectives and new competencies to drive these changes.\n\nNEW ARCHITECTURE\n\nDSTA embarked on a journey to develop an architecture to\nmanage and host the ICS centrally. The team started looking\nat what the IT domain could offer, and how they could bring\ntogether and leverage the best of the IT and OT domains. The\njourney started with industry exploration, where the team spoke\nto established ICS vendors to understand where they were in\nterms of their IT and cybersecurity maturity. Not surprisingly,\n3 is a summary of the various levels of industry maturity for ICS\nin the environment. In the case of Building Automation Systems\n(BAS), in order to meet their commercial customer needs,\nmany were already moving onto the cloud and offering services\nsuch as data analytics to aid owners to better manage utilities\nconsumption. On the other end of the scale, fuel management\nsystems were still very traditional and proprietary, as their key\ncustomers\u2019 focus was on system availability.\n\n\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\n15\n\fWith this wide spectrum of products, vendors and use cases,\nthe team deliberated on an architecture to manage and control\nthese diverse systems centrally. Taking a systematic approach,\nthe team evaluated each of these systems to assess the need\nto centralise and/or virtualise them at the local camp/base level.\nThe architecture also had to support other business use cases\nwhich required connectivity to other enterprise networks, in a\nsecure and effective manner.\n\nmanage ICS systems. The architecture was developed starting\nfrom the local campus OT. This was the centre piece of the\narchitecture as it required a new way to architect and design\ntraditional networking of ICS systems. As new business needs\narose, to facilitate connectivity of the local OT network to other\nIT applications, the architecture was expanded to consider\nsecured linkages to Enterprise networks. The subsequent\nsections will explain the considerations taken in developing\neach of these parts of the architecture."}

QUESTION : {Model to insert question}, \nANSWER: {Model to insert answer} \nText :\nThe team started by examining which systems should be\nconsolidated, taking into consideration the safety and availability\naspects of each of the ICS, and also the digital maturity and\nsystems. A safety critical system that was first considered was\nthe fire alarm systems. Fire alarm systems consist of sensors\nand simple PLCs, as their primary role is to sound an alarm\nduring a fire outbreak to alert building occupants or a central\noperations centre. While they are increasingly integrated into\nBAS to alert operators, fire alarm systems are meant to operate\nautomonously with little interaction and reliance on IT systems.\nHence, in the proposed architecture, the team decided to set\nthem up as standalone systems.\n\nFor the more digitalised systems, such as physical security\nand BAS, the challenge was to virtualise them and yet be\nable to ensure logical segmentation to limit the propagation of\ncyberattacks across different sub-systems. The team explored\nthe implementation of Virtual LANs (VLANs) to segment the\n\n\nLocal Campus Network Infrastructure\n\nThe vision of the team was to set up a common OT network\nin each of the local camps and bases, moving away from\nthe traditional standalone and bespoke networks for each of\nthese ICS. This was to realise the objectives of (1) reducing\nmaintenance efforts of many standalone networks; (2) providing\ngreater asset and cybersecurity visibility of the ICS; and (3)\nenabling the consolidation of data to fulfill business needs.\n\n16 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\ndifferent ICS sub-systems on the OT network. This required\nthe team to work closely with the vendors to ensure correct\ndevices were assigned the correct VLANs and tight control of\nthe firewall rules. When testing out this configuration in one\nof the building projects, the team had to overcome some of\nthe technical limitations of the PLCs, which had hardcoded\nIP addresses. The team worked closely with the ICS vendors\nto implement this concept for over 20 systems, in many\nother camps and systems. The systems were tested to be\n\fOPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITY ROADMAP: ARCHITECTURE AND COMPETENCY AS KEY ENABLERS\n\noperational, and vulnerability assessments were conducted to\nvalidate the security implementation.\n\nHaving a large number of standalone systems also resulted\nin huge maintenance efforts to maintain their cybersecurity\nposture. The man-effort required to patch 50 standalone\nnetworks consisting of different equipment types, operating\nsystems and applications would take around 90 days. The team\nvalidated that this effort could be reduced by three-fold to one\nmonth by implementing a common infrastructure management\nsystem. Setting up a common infrastructure management\nsystem was also necessary to enable operators to manage\nthe more complex consolidated IT and OT infrastructure with\ntechnology and automation. The automated tools were able to\nfacilitate IT asset visibilty and collection of security logs.\n\nThere were internal debates about the pitfalls of a standalone\nversus centralised solution. The inhererent risks of cascading\nfailures and reduction in systems resiliency in a centralised\ninfrastructure were fully recognised. However, weighing the\nimpact of future manpower constraints, and the ability to\nleverage technology to secure and monitor multiple standalone\nsystems, the centralised solution was deemed an appropriate\ntrade-off.\n\nConnectivity to External Networks\n\nSome of the key operational capabilities of the Singapore\nArmed Forces (SAF) depend on the ability to piece together\ninformation from different domains - physical, digital, cyber \u2014\nto derive insights and come up with a plan to out manoeuvre\nadversaries quickly and decisively."}

For\nexample, a pilot was started to enhance the clearance process\nfor visitors to enter camps/bases by leveraging Internet facing\napplications (which have wide user reach) for visitor pre-\nregistration. These applications have secure interfaces with\nthe physical security systems within the camps/bases to allow\nthe entry of approved visitors.\n\nSuch new business requirements require security controls\nto mitigate the propagation of threats across the IT and OT\ndomain. One of the key enablers is a Demilitarised Zone (DMZ)\nto secure information exchanges. While this DMZ usually\ncomprises firewalls and proxy servers, the nature and criticality\nof our systems required custom developed security gateways\nto secure data exchanges to a high level of assurance, and yet\nmeet the business latency needs.\n\nAnother use case is to enhance work productivity with a\ncentralised management and control centre to manage many\nICS across multiple SAF facilities more effectively. While this\nconcept is not new commercially, it is more challenging in\nthe defence context to connect all the camp/base level BAS\nwhile maintaining the overall system resilience. The central\nmonitoring architecture is still a work in progress.\n\nOperationalising the Architecture\n\nToday, the architecture has been refined, tested in slices and\nexpanded to support more use cases. The deployment across\nSAF facilities will be done in phases as there are extensive ICS\nand IT infrastructure requirements, which will need to be timed\nwith the refresh of each facility\u2019s ICS.\n\nWith the introduction of the new architecture, important and\nfundamental conversations have started on how to manage\nthese ICS as systems become \u201csmarter\u201d and increasingly vital\nin daily operations of camps and bases. This will continue\nto evolve, as the new concept and architecture is trialled,\nimplemented and put in operation.\n\nNEW COMPETENCY DEVELOPMENT\n\nOperational Technology, Information\nTechnology and Cybersecurity\n\nThe area of critical infrastructure requires cross domain\nexpertise, as OT experts may not understand IT well, and vice\nversa. This is a recognised problem at the national level. To this\nend, CSA had also embarked on the development of OTCCF\nto guide the career pathways for OT cybersecurity engineers.\n\nStarting from OT\n\nIn DSTA, building and infrastructure engineers with deep ICS\ndomain knowledge have been identified and trained in the\nareas of IT and cybersecurity competencies. This approach\nhas enabled the infrastructure engineers to apply IT best\npractices quickly to secure systems that they are familiar with,\nand work in hybrid teams with IT and cyber engineers to realise\na security-by-design architecture for ICS.\n\nWhile this approach seemed simple, it was a daunting\nundertaking for the small team of engineers, as there was a\nlarge market of ICS vendors with varying IT knowledge and\ncompetencies. Hence, new concepts had to be communicated\nto each and every ICS vendor.

This has\nled to the emergence of new products and tools, such as ICS-\naware firewalls and anomaly detection solutions.\n\nThe challenge for infrastructure engineers is to evaluate\nsuch products and determine their effectiveness. While the\nfunctionality of ICS is well understood, abnormal behaviours\nand potential cyberattacks are not. Hybrid teams were\nestablished to include cyber engineers, and they provided\nknowledge on cyber anomaly detection to aid in system\ndesign and development of detection rulesets. A collaborative\napproach was required for cyber engineers to understand\nbaseline ICS behaviour from the infrastructure engineers, and\nfor the infrastructure engineers to assess the performance\nimplications of proposed security modifications.\n\nDuring the implementation of cybersecurity tools for ICS,\ncyber and infrastructure engineers worked together to\nexamine traffic patterns to ensure that the cyber tools and\nanalytical engine are able to detect attacks, with minimal false\nalarms. This is an interative process and requires commitment\nfrom all involved to find the right balance between effective\ncybersecurity and efficient operations. Adopting this model,\nDSTA has implemented anomaly detection solutions to the\nmost critical ICS systems and is in the process of promulgating\nthese solutions.\n\nDeveloping Engineers with Dual IT and OT\nCompetencies\n\nTo truly do well in the space of ICS cybersecurity, the goal\nis to train and develop hybrid OT/IT engineers who are well\nversed in both the ICS and IT cybersecurity domains. The\ntraining roadmap should take no more than three years to\ndevelop a competent OT/IT engineer. A career map will need\nto be clearly defined for OT/IT engineers to ensure their skills\nand competencies can be continuously developed through\nmeaningful project work. In addition, engineers with the\n\n18 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\npassion to learn can apply their skills and competencies in an\nindustry that is developing, and this can lead to sustainable\ncapability and competency development.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nA capability development journey is one which continues to\nadjust and evolve to meet new needs and evolving threats in\ntechnology. In the nascent space of ICS cybersecurity, the\njourney has only just commenced. The immediate focus is to\nimplement and test out plans and proposed architectures, and\nwhere necessary, make adjustments to improve them. With\nthe progressive build up of many local campus OT networks,\nthe next capability to realise would be an enterprise-level ICS\nnetwork connecting all the local campus OT networks, which\ncan be centrally managed, monitored and provide valuable\noperational data.\n\nAside from the technology, the focus is also on people and\nprocesses. There is a need to continue to develop and grow the\nteam of hybrid IT/OT engineers, through continuous training\nand industry engagement. Significant effort will also need to be\ninvested to develop and operationalise processes to sustain\nthe cybersecurity posture of the ICS, through regular patching,\nlogs reviews and password management. Addressing the key\naspects of people, process and technology will help build\nresiliency against evolving threats to defence ICS.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS"}

They exhibit high energy density, are lightweight, charge\nquickly, have a low self-discharge rate, and a low memory effect. The drive to use lithium batteries in underwater systems has\nincreased the importance of having a deep understanding of lithium battery technologies and safety design considerations.\nThis article describes the challenges in managing the safety of lithium batteries used in underwater systems, and the\n\nmeasures taken to address these safety issues.\n\nKeywords: Li-ion, battery, thermal runaway, system safety, underwater system\n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe importance of lithium battery safety cannot be understated,\nas exemplified by battery-related incidents encountered in the\nBoeing 787 Dreamliner (BBC News, 2013), Samsung Note 7\nmobile phone (BBC News, 2017), and the fires involving lithium\nbatteries in personal mobility devices (Asokan, 2019).\n\nAs naval missions become more complex and demanding,\nmodern underwater (UW) systems are expected to operate\nat high speeds, with long endurance, and be re-deployable.\nAdvancements in rechargeable lithium battery technology\nand their associated high energy density that can meet the\nrequired performance and quick turn-around, are the key\nbenefits of these capabilities. With the proliferation of UW\nsystems using rechargeable lithium batteries, there is a need\nfor greater awareness of lithium battery system design, safety\nqualifications, and potential hazards associated with their usage\nin UW systems.

Much of the information is focused\non the design of the battery and accompanying systems that\nsupport the charge and discharge operations of the battery,\nsuch as monitoring and charging mechanisms.\n\nAs one of the biggest and most worrying hazards associated\nwith Li-ion and Li-ion polymer batteries is that of thermal\nrunaway, this paper will focus on addressing the residual risk\nof thermal runaway. The following section introduces causal\nfactors of thermal runaway, and mitigation measures applicable\nto all systems operating Li-lon batteries. These mitigations are\nto be considered the de rigueur of battery safety.\n\nLithium lon Battery Short Circuit and\nThermal Runaway"}

QUESTION : {Model to insert question}, \nANSWER: {Model to insert answer} \nText :\nLithium lon Battery Short Circuit and\nThermal Runaway\n\nA thermal runaway is described as a hazardous occurrence\nwhereby the rate at which heat is generated within a battery\nexceeds the rate at which the heat can be dissipated to its\nsurroundings. As high temperatures can cause Li-ion cell\nprotection mechanisms to break down, this can lead to a\ndomino effect, where the high heat induces similar reactions\nin neighbouring cells in a self-sustaining pattern; hence the\nterm \u201crunaway\u201d. The result is uncontrolled burning, high\ntemperatures, and venting of gases from the battery, which\ncan happen on a very short time scale. Thermal runaway by\nvarious root causes are elaborated below.\n\nFormation of Dendrites\n\nDendrites are solid lithium metal \u201cspikes\u201d that grow from the\nanode over many charging and discharging cycles. This is part\nof the naturally occurring aging process and thus far cannot\nbe completely eliminated. Dendrites naturally form a sharp\ntip, and as they grow, can eventually pierce the separator,\nleading to a short circuit between the Cathode and Anode\nof the Li-ion battery. The growth of dendrites is accelerated\nby various factors such as over-charging, exceeding the\noperational voltage limits, or using cells beyond the\nmanufacturer-stipulated number of charge cycles. This can be\nmitigated to some extent (but not completely eradicated) by\na comprehensive system of battery monitoring designed into\nthe battery charger or the monitoring component of the battery\nmodule, and observing the manufacturer\u2019s recommended\ncharge-discharge and maintenance cycle.\n\n22 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\nNanyang Technological University has invented a new\nbattery component that can be used as an \u201canti-short layer\u201d\nto overcome short circuits induced by dendrites, and this\ncan potentially reduce the occurrence of this hazard when\nincorporated into the battery (Ang, 2021). This technology is\ncurrently being patented and commercialised.\n\nCharging of Over-Discharged Battery\n\nAll cells (including lead-acid and nickel-based batteries) will\nself-discharge? when left in storage. When a Li-ion cell is stored\nfor prolonged periods below the minimum operating voltage,\ncopper shunts may form between the electrodes, leading to\na direct short-circuit when charging is attempted. This root\ncause can be mitigated by observing the manufacturer\u2019s\nrecommended charge-discharge and maintenance cycle.\n\nInternal Over-Temperature\n\nAll cells will generate some amount of internal Joule heating\nduring charge and discharge because of internal resistance.\nResultant temperatures above the melting point of the\nseparator will lead to its failure, and hence create a short circuit\nbetween the Cathode and Anode. Cooling features that can be\nimplemented include air gaps between cells to minimise self-\nheating and provide adequate dissipation, or heat resistant\nlayers to provide insulation.\n\nExternal Heating\n\nAll batteries are designed to operate within a manufacturer-\nstipulated range of operating temperatures. When a cell is\nutilised outside its intended operating range, a self-reinforcing\nheating cycle (i.e. thermal runaway) may be induced. Heating\nthe cell above the melting point of the separator will induce\nfires due to an internal short-circuit. Users should be mindful\nto incorporate a battery that is designed to operate in the\nintended environment and installation location (away from any\nheat source).\n\nMechanical Abuse"}

QUESTION : {Model to insert question}, \nANSWER: {Model to insert answer} \nText :\nMechanical Abuse\n\nThis refers to physical damage to the cell due to shock,\nvibration or puncturing. If operated beyond the manufacturer-\nstipulated shock/vibration limits, the separator within the\ncell may be punctured, resulting in an internal short-circuit.\nAdditionally, the separator can be directly punctured through\nmechanical means.\n\fSAFETY DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS ON LITHIUM BATTERIES USE IN UNDERWATER SYSTEMS\n\nManufacturing Defects\n\nBattery internal defects due to poor manufacturing processes\nsuch as deformation of cell layers or the presence of\nmicroscopic foreign particles within the cell layers can result\nin thermally hazardous conditions. The selection of reputable\nmanufacturers of battery systems is currently the only means\nto circumvent this, as there will be stringent quality controls\nand sampling checks done by these manufacturers.\n\nIt is hence crucial that all Li-ion batteries are designed,\nmanufactured and tested adequately to ensure safety. A\nwell-designed Battery Management System (BMS) is equally\ncritical to monitor cell characteristics (e.g. temperature) and\nactivities (e.g. charging), and intervene when required (e.g.\nisolation of cells/battery from the charging system to prevent\nfurther charging) to ensure safe operation of battery modules\nand systems.\n\nCorrosion on Connectors and Printed Circuit Boards\n\nThe likelihood of an underwater system being exposed\nto damp conditions during maintenance and storage on\nboard is relatively high, due to the nature of its operating\nenvironment. Over time, corrosion on connectors and printed\ncircuit boards may lead to a short-circuit of the Li-ion battery.\nIt is recommended that the maintainer perform visual\ninspections of these components as part of the system\u2019s\nperiodic preventive maintenance activity, to ensure this does\nnot affect the BMS and battery\u2019s safety.\n\nSAFETY DESIGN APPROACH AND\nDESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR\nLITHIUM BATTERY POWERED\nUNDERWATER SYSTEMS\n\nThe design of an underwater platform and the environment\nin which it operates present unique challenges that\nnecessitate specific considerations to address hazards\nstemming from the use of Li-ion batteries. A systems\nsafety approach of top-level hazard identification and how\neach of its effects can be mitigated or reduced to as low as\nreasonably possible are presented.\n\nTop Level Hazard Identification\nThermal Runaway\n\nVenting of enormous amounts of gases during thermal runaway\nwithin a water-tight pressure hull would lead to the build-up\nof internal pressure and could potentially rupture the hull. The\nkey mitigation for this would be how to prevent catastrophic\naccumulation of internal pressure via, for example, pressure-\nrelief valves.\n\nWater Ingress\n\nIf water comes into contact with the battery, electrolysis could\ntake place. This could lead to the generation of flammable\nhydrogen and oxygen in the vehicle, in turn making the system\nunsafe due to the risk of an explosion. The key mitigations\nfor this would be to prevent water coming into contact with\nthe battery (watertight battery module), to detect water in\nthe underwater system (water and pressure sensors), and to\nimplement appropriate intervention in the event that water is\ndetected within the underwater system (deliberate flooding).\n\nPLATFORM DESIGN TO MITIGATE\nHAZARD EFFECTS"}

QUESTION : {Model to insert question}, \nANSWER: {Model to insert answer} \nText :\nPLATFORM DESIGN TO MITIGATE\nHAZARD EFFECTS\n\nOver and above recommendations in the earlier section to\nprevent thermal runaway, the team recognises that Li-ion\nbatteries in underwater systems are also subject to hazards of\nwater ingress. The team has consulted various guides and best\npractices to recommend the following design considerations\nto prevent and mitigate the effects of water contact with the\nbattery and also against the build-up of internal pressure\nduring thermal runaway.\n\nPressure-relief Valves\n\nUnderwater systems are invariably watertight enclosures.\nAs such, over-pressure due to venting of Li-ion batteries,\nelectrolysis products, and heat build-up inside the underwater\nsystem can catastrophically overcome the system\u2019s yield\nstrength, injuring personnel or damaging property nearby.\nThe implementation of pressure-relief valves on the hull of\nthe system allows one-way release of pent-up pressure to the\nenvironment, to prevent internal pressure from building up to\nunsafe levels. Such valves are designed to vent automatically\nwhen the internal pressure exceeds the external pressure by a\npre-defined value (such as 0.5 or 1 bar).\n\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\n23\n\fWatertight Battery Module\n\nIf an underwater system experiences a collision or otherwise\nhas its watertight integrity compromised, water can eventually\ncome into contact with the battery cells. Even slow leaks\nover long periods of time can let enough water in for this to\nhappen. This can be mitigated by incorporating watertight\nbulkheads within the UW system, although this might not be\npractical for small, compact systems, nor would it help if the\nbattery module itself has a leak (in the event of a collision or\npoor waterproofing).\n\nWater Leakage Sensors\n\nPlacement of water sensors in the battery module will help to\ndetect the presence of water. The detection of water ingress will\ngenerate an alarm to alert users. Water sensors are preferably\nplaced at the lowest possible location in the battery module,\nas water tends to accumulate in such areas, giving users more\nreaction time. Having multiple sensors in different positions\nand heights provides information about the water level and\nthe rate of water ingress, thereby allowing users to assess the\nfeasibility of repair or recovery.\n\nPressure Sensors\n\nUnderwater systems are typically filled to a slight over-\npressure, and pressure sensors within the hull will be able\n\nScuttle valve \u2014\u2014\n\nto detect internal pressure drops through compromised\nwatertight integrity. The pressure sensor will also be able to\ndetect an increase in pressure in the event of battery thermal\nrunaway and the associated venting of gases.\n\nDeliberate Flooding of System"}

The pressure sensor will also be able to\ndetect an increase in pressure in the event of battery thermal\nrunaway and the associated venting of gases.\n\nDeliberate Flooding of System\n\nDisplacing any accumulated or electrolysed gases within\nthe vehicle with seawater through deliberate flooding can\nhelp to eliminate the risk of an explosion. Proper placement\nof scuttle valves is to be considered in the design in order to\nallow seawater to enter and gas to escape. It is especially\nimportant to consider any bulkheads or pockets where gas\ncan accumulate. Once a system is fully flooded and its battery\nexample of a sunken Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)\nin a rested position with scuttle valves opened to allow ingress\nof water. While it may seem counterintuitive to want to flood\nthe vehicle, the design should consider a \u201cpoint of no return\u201d\napproach, where this deliberate flooding is only performed after\na large amount of water (sufficient to come into contact with the\nbattery cells, for example) has entered the vehicle. Strategically\nplaced water sensors (near the battery cell terminals) can serve\nas the trigger point. By the time water has reached this point,\nthe only remaining action would be to minimise the amount of\nresidual gas within the system by flooding the vehicle. Note\nthat there will be the risk of inadvertent activation of scuttle\nvalves, leading to loss of system, which must be considered\nin the design.\n\nScuttle valve\n\nAUV will flood to this level\n\n\n24 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\fSAFETY DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS ON LITHIUM BATTERIES USE IN UNDERWATER SYSTEMS\n\nSAFETY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe hazard of flammable gases from electrolysis of sea water\ncan be better quantified through the following considerations\nthat the team has developed to assess whether an underwater\nsystem is safe, should water enter the battery compartment.\n\nInternal Air Volume\n\nThe system\u2019s internal air volume is used for positive\nbuoyancy as well as convective heat transfer from the internal\ncomponents to the AUV\u2019s hull and then to the surrounding\nwater. This air volume also represents the enclosed space in\nwhich gases can accumulate (known as the residual volume).\nThe residual volume within the system depends on the system\ndesign, final orientation, and the position of the leak (where\nwater is entering the compartment). Since these cannot be\nknown beforehand, the worst-case scenario should be used\n(i.e. scenario with the greatest residual volume). This can be\ncalculated based on the position of the scuttle valves and,\nif there are no scuttle valves, the most likely point of water\ningress (i.e. O-rings) in the system.\n\nAmount of Gas Generated\n\nThe maximum theoretical amount of hydrogen which can be\ncreated through electrolysis when a battery is submerged\nin water is dependent on the amount of electrical charge,\nor Coulombs (C), present in the battery. This should be\ncalculated based on the assumptions that: (1) all the cells are\nindependently performing electrolysis, (2) all electrical charge\ngoes into the electrolysis reaction, and (3) only hydrogen and\noxygen are produced from the electrolysis reaction. These\nthree assumptions create a worst-case scenario, as hydrogen\nand oxygen are the reactants that can form the greatest\nexothermic reaction (i.e., explosive effect).\n\nDuring electrolysis, a reduction reaction takes place at the\ncathode (negatively charged terminal) to form molecular\nhydrogen (H,) from water\u2018. This reaction requires two electrons,\nshown below:"}

This reaction requires two electrons,\nshown below:\n\n2H\u00a5 4 + 27H, (1)\n\nThe number of moles of electrons per unit Coulomb is\nrelated by the Faraday constant, which has a value of\n96,485 Cmol'. Assuming the battery contains X Coulombs\n\nof electrons, the number of moles of electrons in the system\nx\n\n36.485 moles.\n\nbatteries is therefore\n\n \n\nBased on Equation 1, the maximum number of moles of\n\n. x woe .\nH, produced is therefore 56,4a5x0 Moles. This is assuming\nideal faradaic efficiency5 and that the batteries are at\nmaximum charge.\n\nAs stated earlier, this is a worst-case scenario, where only H,\nis produced at the cathode. In reality, seawater also contains\na large variety of ions, such as chloride (CI), bromide (Br),\niodide (I), oxide (O*), sulfate (SO,*), sodium (Na*), potassium\n(K*), magnesium (Mg**), and calcium (Ca**). Each of these\nions can be oxidised or reduced at the battery terminals,\nand preferential reaction is dependent on many chemical\nand kinetic factors. Oxidation and reduction of these ions\ngenerally creates less flammable products than H, and O,.\n\nWith reference to project-related safety assessment efforts\ninvolving submergence of lithium-ion batteries in seawater,\na relatively small proportion of energy actually goes into\ncreating hydrogen and oxygen. During the submergence of the\nbatteries, the following three phenomena were observed:\n\n(1) Heating of seawater through the Joule effectS and\nelectrical arcing\n(2) Electrolysis of seawater into hydrogen and oxygen\n\n(3) Oxidation of the battery terminals\n\nThese three phenomena represent different outcomes\ncompeting for the stored energy in the battery. The majority\nof the stored energy (approximately 80 - 90%) goes into the\nJoule effect and electrical arcing. In addition, the oxygen\nrequired for oxidation of battery terminals can only be drawn\nfrom that created by electrolysis\u2019. This in turn leads to a dearth\nof oxygen through which combustion cannot occur. While this\ndoes mean that there is a non-stoichiometric mix of hydrogen\nand oxygen within the system in its steady state, opening the\nsystem on the surface could potentially introduce sufficient\noxygen for a reaction to occur, albeit for a brief window of\ntime\u2019. If the team assesses that there are pockets of gas within\nwhich hydrogen can accumulate, sufficient care must be taken\nduring the recovery process to vent this accumulated gas and\nprevent combustion.\n\nCombustion Environment\n\nCombustion requires all three sides of the fire triangle as shown\nenvironment in the system does not meet any of the following\nthree conditions, combustion will not occur:\n\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\n25\n\f(1) Oxygen - The amount of oxygen in the system must be\ngreater than 5% for combustion to occur.\n\n(2) Heat - There must be heat within the system to ignite the\ngases.

This recommended distance is\ntypically observed for a duration of 24 hours from occurrence\nof the incident as it is assumed that by then, residual\nhazardous gas would have dissipated into its environment, the\nbattery would have fully discharged into water, or the batteries\ncontacts would have become corroded such that they can\nno longer discharge.

The team also ensures that the stowage\n(including during transportation) of the UW systems is away\nfrom heat sources or solar radiation to maintain the correct\noperating temperature within the battery.\n\nState of Charge\n\nThe team would additionally recommend that manufacturers\nfurnish proof of battery qualification and testing certification\nwith information to quantify occurrence of thermal runaway\nat different States of Charge (SOC) or level of charge of the\nbattery. Passing safety certifications (e.g. UL164 - general\nLi-ion standard, UN38.3 - for transportation, SAE J2464 - for\nelectric vehicles) is one of the ways of ensuring sound battery\ndesign. Performing tests such as the High Temperature Test\nor Nail-Penetration Test to incite thermal runaway conditions\nmay reveal if the internal battery design is able to prevent\nsympathetic spreading of thermal runaway. These tests can\nalso be performed at different SOCs to determine if there is a\nthreshold below which thermal runaway will not occur, even\nunder such extreme abuse levels. With this consideration, the\nuser should consider safety vis-a-vis battery endurance at safe\nSOC levels to ensure operational success.\n\nCONCLUSION"}

Advances in computer technology allowed\nfaster completion of these assessments and allowed the enhancement of tools with higher fidelity computation.

It also discusses\nthe various software tools developed in-house for different\nassessment scenarios back in the early 1990s. With the\nadvancement of computer technology, older software tools\nhad to be upgraded to avoid obsolescence and the result was\nthe development of a new fragmentation assessment software\nnamed MAESD that consolidates the functions and strengths\nof each preceding software tool.\n\nFRAGMENTATION\n\nFragmentation warheads are usually designed as thick metal\ncasings, also known as shells, packed with high explosives.\nUpon initiation of the explosive payload, the explosive\npresssures within the shells/metal casings expand and\neventually break the casing into numerous fragments, each\n\fpossessing energy to potentially incapitate the targets that\nthey can reach.\n\nThe lethality of the warhead would thus depend on the\nwarhead fragmentation characteristics such as fragmentation\ndistribution, fragment shape, mass and velocity. These can be\nobtained from static fragmentation distribution tests known as\nArena Tests. However, warheads are usually delivered over a\ncertain distance, and thus lethality is also dependent on the\nwarhead terminal conditions such as warhead velocity, angle\n\n(2) US Damage Criteria - A study was conducted on human\nproxies to establish a relationship between personnel\nperforming certain tactical roles (i.e. Assault, Defence\nand Supply) against specified time durations (e.g. 30\nseconds, 5 minutes, half a day) before they succumb to\ninjuries sustained from fragmentation effects. Results were\nthen translated into equations and constants for each of\nthe role-duration combination, which are then applied to\nfragmentation analyses on personnel.\n\n\nThese parameters are used to determine each fragment\u2019s\ntrajectory by considering resultant fragment velocities\n(i.e. speed and direction) and air drag. With knowledge of\nfragment mass, speed and the direction they are headed\ntowards, assessments can be done to see if the fragments are\neffective against the intended targets. Thereafter, depending\non the type of target, different equations and considerations\nare applied to analyse if fragments are indeed hazardous or\neffective. These include:\n\n(1) Energy Criteria - Similar to assessing injuries from a\nbaseball impact (blunt trauma), there are standards and\nliterature that propose a spectrum of injuries based on\nimpact energies.\n\n(3) Thor Penetration Equations - These are derived based\non empirical data from trials that provide a deeper level of\nassessment on effects of steel fragments against different\nthicknesses of various materials. These are applicable for\nnon-personnel targets only.\n\nEARLY FORMS OF FRAGMENT\nLETHALITY ASSESSMENT\n\nIn the early years, engineering assessments were mainly\nfocused on how well the warhead was able to neutralise the\ntarget and/or the safety distance required when training in\nproximity.

However, computers then were not as advanced and\n\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\n31\n\fthe generation of results to assess performance or safety\ncould take up to several hours or days. Hence, performance\nand safety simulations and calculations were to be executed\nseparately, incurring more time and effort. The following\ntools, namely Mean Area of Effectiveness (MAE), CONTOUR\nand FLAP3D, and the different scenarios they were each\nused for.\n\nMAE was designed for near field effects on personnel targets\nin an area at ground level. Near field trajectory analysis\nfocuses on fragments that are directed towards the ground\nupon warhead detonation. As fragments have high initial\nvelocities, those directed to the ground are less affected by\nair drag and gravity, and thus were assumed to have linear\nusing the US Damage criterion. MAE is typically used for\nwarhead performance assessments where the interest is on\nwarhead effectiveness against personnel targets that are in\nclose proximity to the warhead\u2019s detonation point. As MAE\nis mostly used for analysing terminal effects, at the end of a\nflight trajectory, the required angle of fall input is limited to\ndownward pointing angles only rather than an upward pointing\nwarhead at launch.\n\n\n32 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\nTo assess for safety distances, CONTOUR used similar\nmethods as MAE (i.e. fragment trajectory tracking) but\nit also considers fragments with parabolic trajectories in\naddition to linear trajectories. For safety considerations,\nthe threshold of probability of personnel incapacitation can\nbe as low as one in a million, as opposed to only one in a\nhundred for MAE calculations. In order to do so, there is a\nneed to examine the trajectories of fragments that are not\n3). Other than assessments on personnel, CONTOUR is also\nable to simulate the fragments hitting metal plates of various\nthicknesses which are used as proxies for vehicular platforms.\nCONTOUR was also the only software that allows for warhead\ndispersion considerations, such as probable errors in range\nand dispersion, to be included in the assessment. Unlike MAE,\nCONTOUR allows upward pointing warhead angles to allow for\nsimulations of warheads exploding during different phases of\nits flight trajectory. An example of using CONTOUR is illustrated\n(probably due to a defective fuze that prematurely initiatied the\nwarhead moments after launching) were simulated and clearly\nshowed that most fragments would be directed forward and\naway from the firing position where personnel are located.\n\n\fEVOLUTION OF DSTA\u2019S FRAGMENTATION LETHALITY ASSESSMENT\n\n\nFLAP8D is similar to CONTOUR in terms of tracking\nfragment trajectories, but unlike CONTOUR that handles\ntwo-dimensional targets on the ground, FLAP8D is designed\nfor three-dimensional targets anywhere in space such as air\ntargets or even humans in elevated structures, such as fifth\n\n\nMAE3D\n\nWith the improvement of computer technology, computational\ntimelines have shifted from days to minutes. At the same time,\noperating systems (OS) such as MS Windows were evolving\nquickly and soon there was a concern that the software would\nnot be able to run on newer OSs. The team then embarked\non converting the software using modern coding languages\nsuch as C++, and was able to combine all three software into\na one-stop fragmentation assessment tool. The one-stop tool\nwas named MAESD as it combined the best features from\nits three software predecessors. In addition, new algorithms\nwere added to enable the interaction with obstacles such as\nbuildings and structures. With this important new feature,\nMAE3D was ready for further enhancements that would\nstrengthen the engineering analyses and make it useful for\nfield operations."}

As the area of operations became\nmore and more urbanised, the effects of shielding from\nobstacles such as buildings and structures became more\nsignificant. The ability for MAE3D to consider interactions\nwith obstacles/buildings makes it more effective to assess\nreal-world physical situations. An example of the interaction is\ntall obstacles that are capable of preventing fragments from\nreaching beyond them, and the black object represents a\nshorter building where higher trajectory fragments are able to\nbe lobbed past the building.\n\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\n33\n\fNote:\n1) Different colour zones depict different bands of Probability of Incapacitation.\n2) Dark red zone denotes very high probability while dark blue zone denotes very low or no probability.\n\n\nMap Reading Capability\n\nThe inclusion of obstacles was made possible with another\n\ninput file where the basic shape of the building was defined\n\nwith a few other parameters such as length, height and radius\n\n(for circular obstacle such as tree). In this example, only three\n\nobstacles were defined and illustrated. It would not be practical\n\nthen for any user to have to create the obstacles input file for\n\na dense urban terrain.

While a little\nincrease in run-time is not a major concern for engineering\nanalyses, it will become a significant issue if the capability is to\nbe implemented in field operational systems. In view of this, the\nteam began efforts to explore parallel processing methods. The\nbasic idea is that while MAESD has a lot of loops in its coding,\nsuch as tracking the trajectory of each and every fragment\nwhich generally takes the bulk of the processing time, it is\npossible to instruct a second processor core to perform part\nof the calculations. With two or more processors sharing the\ncomputational load, the time needed for generation of results\nis expected to be reduced significantly.

In the 1960s, the US Army conducted trials to\ndetermine the resistance of different materials to penetration\nby steel fragments. From the trials, empirical equations (later\nnown as Thor Equations) were derived. However, as these\nare regressed equations based on empirical results, the\nusefulness is subjected to the boundaries of the experiments,\nsuch as limited types of material and material thickness being\nested upon as well as the shape, size, material composition\nand impact velocity of the fragment.

Using MAE3D to assess fragmentation\neffects of SAF warheads can help to better understand the\nsafety of munition storage facilities.\n\nWarhead Effectiveness in Plantations\n\nIn the past, when assessing warhead lethality in plantations,\nengineers had to superimpose the layout and spatial separation\nbetween trees in the plantation over the results generated by\nMAE. The main assumption for such studies was that the trees\nwould be thick enough to stop any fragments. Thereafter,\n\f\u201cstraight lines\u201d were plotted out from the detonation point\ntowards the trees. Finally, any lethality effects \u201cbehind the\ntree\u201d were assumed to be negated and removed manually. This\nwas a tedious and inaccurate method but it provided a rough\nestimate of lethality degradation in a plantation. Now with\nthe obstacle generation feature in MAESD, the terrain details\ncan be generated relatively easily and their effects are clearly\nof human error when manually amending the lethality results\naffected by the plantation trees.\n\nNote:\n\nEVOLUTION OF DSTA\u2019S FRAGMENTATION LETHALITY ASSESSMENT\n\nachieve this, MAE3D is not developed as a \u201cplug-and-play\u201d\nsolution and integration uncertainties such as processing\nspeeds, C2 workflows and availability of relelvant map data\nwill challenge the integration efforts.\n\nFor instance, while most C2 systems have incorporated digital\nmaps, some may not contain the necessary data for MAE3D\nto generate urban obstacles and analyse fragment-obstacle\ninteraction. On the other hand, MAE3D has only been coded\nand verified to extract data from very limited range of map data\n\n1) Different colour zones depict different bands of Probability of Incapacitation.\n\nOTHER POTENTIAL FUTURE\nAPPLICATIONS\n\nAside from consolidating three different programmes into\nMAES8D, the obstacle generation feature was a significant\nenhancement to the fragmentation\ncapability.

While there are ongoing efforts to\n\nformats. Hence, more work is required to prepare MAE3D to\nread and extract from a wider variety of map data formats.\n\nAnother potential application is to implement MAE3D for\ncrowd control during on-site war relic disposal.

There may even not be a need for the\nsandbag wall if the fragmentation distances are found to be\nlimited through the use of MAE3D.\n\nThe main challenge of war relic disposal is that the warhead\ncharacteristics are often unknown and the disposal team will\nhave to make conservative assumptions on the cordoning\nefforts.

A task force was formed to investigate the key factors that affected\npropagation of detonation sounds from live firing activities and to establish noise mitigation measures. Root cause analysis\nand literature research revealed that the most likely causes were adverse atmospheric conditions and certain ammunition-\nrelated parameters. Sound trials were conducted to validate noise mitigation measures related to atmospheric conditions\nthat were employed by Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, USA and to explore other possible mitigation measures by\nadjusting ammunition-related parameters. Analyses of past year local atmospheric data and sound trials were conducted\nto quantify the effects of atmospheric parameters on sound propagation. Noise mitigation measures were developed after\nanalysis of the results of sound trials which quantified the effects of ammunition-related parameters on detonation sound\nlevels. The main highlights from the literature research, trials, analysis and recommendations for noise mitigation measures\nwill be presented in this article.\n\nKeywords: noise, sound, detonation, wind, live-firing\n\n \n\nfor up to 28 seconds per day. For the purpose of this technical\nstudy, 115dB is taken to be the reference sound level threshold.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nDue to the limited land space in Singapore, certain live firing\n\nactivities are conducted on an offshore southern island. In\n2017 and 2019, residents in the southern parts of Singapore\nprovided feedback about loud sounds and vibrations, and\nthese were traced to detonation sounds arising from the live\nfiring activities on the southern island.\n\nA technical study was conducted to identify the main\ncontributing factors that enhance sound propagation and\ndetermine suitable noise mitigation measures in order to\naddress public concerns.\n\nThe threshold for noise annoyance established by the\nAmerican National Standards Institute is 120dB. While there is\nno annoyance threshold set by the local National Environment\nAgency (NEA) for impulse noises, NEA regulations on noise\nhazards dictate the permissible exposure limits to be at 115dB\n\n40 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022"}

Wind is\nmoving air caused by air pressure differences. When sound\nwaves move through air, sound waves follow the direction\nof the wind.\n\nThe vertical wind gradient is defined as the rate of change\nof horizontal wind speed against the altitude above ground\nlevel. Vertical wind gradients cause sound to refract\nupwards or downwards (Wright, 1994). Stronger winds at\nhigher altitudes and weaker winds at lower altitudes will\ncreate a positive wind gradient and thus cause sound to\ndownwind of a sound source to hear louder sounds\ndue to the summation of the primary and the refracted\nsoundwaves. Conversely, weaker winds at higher altitudes\nand strong winds at lower altitudes will cause sound to\nbend upwards and away from the ground.\n\nLarger differences in wind speed across altitudes also\ncontribute to greater vertical wind gradients and thus\nintensify the refraction of sound either towards or away\nfrom the ground (Wright, 1994).\n\n\n(2) Wind Direction - Since sound propagates through the\nair, the wind direction affects the propagation of sound\nby refracting the soundwaves towards the direction of\nthe wind.\n\n(3\n\nTemperature Inversion - Temperature inversion is the\nphenomenon that occurs when the normal air temperature\ngradient in the atmosphere is reversed (Naval Air Weapons\nStation China Lake, 2013). Air temperature typically\ndecreases with height as the sun heats up the ground,\n\nwhich heats the air directly above it first. This occurs most\noften on clear nights when the ground cools off rapidly by\nradiation. In the mornings following these clear nights, the\ncold ground temporarily keeps the air at lower altitude at\nresulting in temperature inversion. This layer of warm air\nforms a boundary which traps air pollutants and reflects\nsound waves downwards back to the ground (Parnell,\n2015), causing the soundwaves to travel further and be\nheard over larger distances.\n\ntemperature inversion\n\nKey Ammunition-Related Parameters That\nAffect Sound Propagation\n\nThe ammunition-related parameters of interest are as follows:\n(1) Net Explosive Quantity\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n6)\n\n5) Detonation pit layout\n\nCased versus uncased ammunition\nDetonation method\nHazard Division\n\n(1) Net Explosive Quantity (NEQ) - An ammunition with a\nlarger NEQ will produce higher blast overpressure (higher\nsound level) as compared to one with a smaller NEQ."}

The noise incident that occurred in Apr 2019 revealed\nthat not only were the atmospheric conditions unfavourable,\nthere were large amounts of uncased charges used. This\n\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\n41\n\fcould have been a significant contributing factor that\nresulted in the excessive sound produced.\n\n(3) Detonation Method - Three methods of detonation are\nof interest in this study, namely surface, sub-surface, and\noverburden. For surface detonation, ammunition are placed\non bare ground and detonated. Sub-surface detonation\nrequires pits to be dug beforehand for placement of\nammunition in the pits. Overburden detonation requires pits\nto be dug, placement of ammunition in the pits, followed by\ncovering of the pit with soil before detonation.\n\n(4) Hazard Division (HD) - Ammunition are classified\ninto different HDs. It was postulated that the blast\noverpressure generated could vary for different HDs\ngiven the same NEQ.\n\n(5) Detonation Pit Layout - It was hypothesised that a single\npit of 200kg NEQ will produce a higher blast overpressure\nas compared to two pits of 100kg NEQ each. This could\nbe due to the separation distance between the pits, slight\ndifference in detonation timing due to varying detonation\ncord lengths as well as the cancellation of some of the\nsound waves due to wave interference from the two\nsound sources.\n\nMETHODOLOGY OF TECHNICAL\nSTUDY\n\nConduct of Sound Trial to Validate\nEffectiveness of Atmospheric Criteria and\nAmmunition-Related Parameters\n\nAtmospheric Conditions\n\nThe trials were conducted to validate the set of atmospheric\ncriteria and quantify the effects of atmospheric parameters on\nsound propagation.\n\nThere are however challenges faced in relying solely on\natmospheric conditions as the only means of sound mitigation\nto determine if live firing activities can proceed. The allowable\ntime window for live firing activities is between 10am to 6pm.\nHowever, data for the atmospheric parameters of interest used\nto determine the atmospheric condition across the day are\nonly available twice daily at 8am and 8pm when meteorological\nballoons are released by Meteorological Service Singapore.\nThere is a risk of atmospheric conditions changing during the\nperiod between 8am and 8pm. While real time ground level\n\n42 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\natmospheric data are available, they are inadequate as the\nparameters of interest require data across different altitudes.\n\nAdditionally, live firing activities may be aborted in the event\nthat atmospheric conditions are unfavourable.

QUESTION : {Model to insert question}, \nANSWER: {Model to insert answer} \nText :\nAdditionally, live firing activities may be aborted in the event\nthat atmospheric conditions are unfavourable. Logistics costs\nwill thus be incurred to bring the ammunition back to mainland\nSingapore. This will impact operations and training as the\ndetonation will have to be postponed until another slot for live\nfiring activities is available.\n\nAmmunition-related Parameters\n\nIt is therefore important to also explore ammunition-related\nnoise mitigation measures to be less reliant on favourable\natmospheric conditions, so that noise mitigation can be\ntailored for live firing configurations during seasons with\ngenerally unfavourable atmospheric conditions. Hence, sound\ntrials were also designed to explore and quantify the effects\nof ammunition-related parameters on detonation sound levels.\n\nData Visualisation and Analysis\n\nA data visualisation tool was used to visualise the sound data\nfor ease of gleaning insights into the effects of atmospheric\nand ammunition-related parameters. Analysis of the data and\ntrial results will enable the implementation of suitable noise\nmitigation measures for live firing activities conducted on\nthe island.\n\nSOUND TRIAL\nDesign of Sound Trial\n\nOne sound meter was placed at the source of the sound which\nis on the island where the detonations take place, and another\nwas placed at the sound receiver on mainland Singapore.\nSentosa was chosen as the location for the sound receiver\nas it is the nearest residential area to the island where the\ndetonations take place.\n\nSet of Atmospheric Criteria\n\nTo continue with live firing activities and proceed with sound\ntrials while maintaining an acceptable level of noise that will\nnot raise public concerns, a set of atmospheric criteria was\ndevised to determine whether live firing activities should\nproceed or not. The set of atmospheric criteria consists of\nrestrictions in terms of (1) wind gradient, (2) wind speed, and\n(3) wind direction.\n\fThe criteria were adapted from the criteria used by Naval Air\nWeapons Station (USA) to our local context after reviewing past\nyear local atmospheric data. Since literature studies indicate\nthat the likelihood of occurrence of temperature inversion is low\nduring summer and from late morning onwards due to warm\nconditions (Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, 2013), it\nis assessed that temperature inversion can be omitted from\nthe atmospheric criteria considering our local weather and that\nusual live firing activities\u2019 start from 10am onwards.\n\nTo validate the atmospheric criteria, a preliminary trial was\nconducted from August to September 2019. The highest\ndetonation sound recorded during this period at 92.4dB on\nmainland Singapore was attributed to a considerably large NEQ\nunder near unfavourable atmospheric conditions with medium\nwind blowing towards Singapore and negative wind gradient.\n92.4dB is more than 20dB below the public annoyance\nthreshold of 115dB, which translates to the sound being four\ntimes softer. It was thus validated that the atmospheric criteria\nare adequate to address concerns of detonation sounds.\n\nCalibration Blow\n\nIn the event of unfavourable atmospheric conditions, live\nfiring activities and sound trials would have to be cancelled\nand ammunition would be brought back from the island to\nmainland Singapore. This will impact operations and training.\nFurthermore, sound trials will not be able to take place in the\nevent of unfavourable atmospheric conditions, as the range of\natmospheric conditions suitable for data collection is limited.\n\nS/N Trial Objective\n\nMANAGEMENT OF NOISE FROM LIVE FIRING ACTIVITIES\n\nIn order to continue with the live firing activities and proceed\nwith sound trials to collect data during unfavourable\natmospheric conditions, calibration blows were conducted\nwhen atmospheric conditions were unfavourable to assess if\nthe live firing activities and sound trials can proceed."}

However, there was a lack\nof such wind conditions during the trial period. There was also\na lack of a range of wind direction with similar wind speed\nand gradient on the trial days. Hence, the effects of wind\n\fspeed and wind gradient on sound attenuation could not be\nquantified conclusively.\n\nAssessment on Key Atmospheric Factors\n\nWind direction was assessed to have a significant impact on\nsound attenuation. Although the effects of wind speed and\nwind gradient were unable to be quantified conclusively,\nliterature research has shown that these atmospheric factors\ndo affect sound attenuation.

Sound levels from\ndetonation of a single large NEQ item per pit (two pits of 144kg\nNEQ each) were around 10dB higher on average compared to\n8). This affirms our understanding that detonation of single\nlarge NEQ items would generate higher blast overpressure\nthan a pile of smaller NEQ items adding up to the same NEQ\nas a single charge detonates all at once compared to multiple\nsmaller detonations in succession. This single detonation will\ngenerate a single uniform shockwave outward whilst multiple\ndetonations will generate multiple shockwaves that might not\nmerge together due to the slight time difference in detonation.\n\nMoreover, sound levels from detonation of a single large cased\nNEQ item were higher than that of multiple small uncased\nNEQ items despite the latter having a larger total NEQ than\nthe former (400kg compared to 288kg).

In Singapore, contact tracing is one of our\nstrategies and is led by the Ministry of Health (MOH) with\nsupport from various government agencies.\n\nIn March 2020 when Singapore experienced multiple new\nclusters and an increasing number of unlinked cases daily,\nMOH reached out to DSTA for engineering support to\nstrengthen and augment MOH\u2019s contact tracing effort.\n\nThis article describes the key considerations behind the\nNetwork Analysis Tool developed by the multidisciplinary DSTA\n\n52 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\nteam that was embedded in MOH\u2019s contact tracing team.

It\nalso explains how the tool helped to streamline and improve\nthe contact tracing process.\n\nUNDERSTANDING CONTACT\nTRACING\n\nThe contact tracing process can be segregated into forward\n\nForward contact tracing focuses on identifying close\ncontacts to whom COVID-19 positive patients could have\npassed the virus to during their infectious period. The\npurpose is to anticipate and break the transmission cycle\nby isolating the close contacts. Forward contact tracing\nlooks at the activities of infected person three to five days\nbefore the onset of symptoms until the person is admitted\nto hospital/community care facility (CCF) for isolation, as\nthe infected person could already be transmitting the virus\nbefore experiencing any symptoms.\n\fOn the other hand, backward contact tracing focuses on\nestablishing the source of infection and identifying clusters. It\naims to remove the source of transmission and prevent further\ninfection. For example, a restaurant may have asymptomatic\nstaff who are unaware that they were infected and continue\nto infect others while working. Through backward contact\ntracing, such locations are identified for further investigation\nto establish the source of infection. Backward contact tracing\nlooks at the activities of the person up to 14 days prior to the\nonset of symptoms.\n\nThis article focuses on backward contact tracing as the team\u2019s\nwork centred on identifying sources and clusters of infection\nfor epidemiology investigations.\n\nBesides the challenge of analysing the large amount of\ninformation, some of the data in the activity maps were in\nfree text and there was a need to search through and analyse\nthis information efficiently. There was also a need to visualise\ngeospatially where the potential COVID-19 hotspots were.\n\nThese challenges drove the requirement to digitise the process\nand incorporate data analytics which could elucidate the\ninteractions among the thousands of cases more efficiently.\n\n\nCHALLENGES IN BACKWARD\nCONTACT TRACING\n\nInitially, backward contact tracing was done by a team of\nepidemiology officers who would run through the \"activity\nmaps\" of the infected cases, and try to correlate multiple\nbranches of information across the different cases to establish\nlinkages. Before being tested positive, each patient could\ntypically have up to 100 close contacts and visited more than\n30 locations over the 14 days.\n\nThis process was manual and memory-intensive. The rapidly\nincreasing cases in the early stages of the pandemic worsened\nthe problem, as there was a surge in the amount of data to be\nanalysed, making this manual process unmanageable.\n\nTHE BACKWARD CONTACT\nTRACING TOOLKIT\n\nOverview of the Toolkit\n\nThe challenges identified in backward contact tracing were\nmulti-faceted and required a multi-pronged approach to handle\nthe operational needs.

Besides its\ntheory could be used to analyse trends and clusters and have\nbeen applied in various government and commercial products\n(Zagalsky, 2020) (Jain, Liu, Sarda, & Molino, 2019).\n\nIn addition, the team had experience in applying the network-\nbased analysis approach in other domains such as identifying\nterrorism threats within the shipping community. These\nexperiences and tacit knowledge enabled the team to deliver\na minimum viable product quickly within weeks to support\ncontact tracing operations.\n\n54 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\nWhat is Network Analysis?\n\nIn Network Analysis, information such as locations, activities,\nclose contacts and case details are fused together and\ncases and uncovering clusters of infections.\n\nIn order to form the network representation efficiently to\nsupport real-time analysis, the data needs to be properly\nstructured and stored. In this aspect, transactional (row-\nwise) data structures using Structured Query Language (SQL)\ndatabase would be sub-optimal. SQL queries would be ill-\nfitting and more prone to errors. For example, if one needed\nto know the contacts of cases who had visited a specific\nlocation at a particular time, transactional data structures\nwould require complex SQL joins across multiple tables\nwhich can be computationally intensive and slow. In contrast,\nqueries to map out the COVID-19 transmission landscape\nwhich can identify links and emerging clusters more easily.\nselected for Network Analysis.\n\n\n(1) Link discovery: Cases that are directly connected\n\n(2) Cluster discovery: Cases that are in close proximity\n\n(3) 2nd degree relationship: Identification of potentially\ninfected, asymptomatic person\n\n\fIncorporating Data Analytics\n\nAnalytic algorithms were also incorporated into the tool to\ndetect clusters automatically by analysing links between cases\nwho had visited a common location in a particular timeframe.\nThe algorithms enabled the tool to highlight overlaps in time\nand location between unlinked and linked cases, thereby\nuncovering hidden links between cases. Besides shortening\nthe contact tracing process, they allowed contact tracers to\nsieve out potential commonalities such as locations visited\nwhich were crucial in finding potential clusters.\n\nanalysing the data:\n\n* Community detection algorithms such as the Louvain\nalgorithm!

They were rich sources of information\nthat described what the places the cases visited and the types\nof activities there. Contact tracers needed to be able to search\nthrough this information efficiently.\n\nOne straightforward solution was to directly search the raw\ntext/CSV files. However, with the burgeoning amount of data,\nthis became increasingly slow and inefficient. Furthermore,\nthere was also a need to filter the textual search results with\nadditional constraints such as date/time, case number and\ncluster. An example of such a query might be to list down all\nthe cases who had visited a specific location (Location A) from\nwithin a certain date range (e.g. 1st to 15th May).\n\nMoreover, due to misspellings and spelling inconsistencies,\ndoing a manual search meant that one had to consider different\nspelling permutations of a word. This was unreliable and\ninefficient. Hence, there was a need for a tool that could first\nperform a search and return the results quickly, then perform\na fuzzy search to accommodate for spelling inconsistencies.\n\nUse of Elasticsearch as a Search Engine\n\nElasticsearch is a scalable NoSQL database (this is a non-\ntabular database which stores data in a format different from\nrelational tables. In Elasticsearch, data is stored in a document\nformat.) based on the Lucene library that provides scalable,\nnear real-time, full-text search. It is built upon JavaScript\nObject Notation (JSON) documents that are optimised for full\ntext search capabilities and data aggregation.\n\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\n55\n\fElasticsearch is commonly used in the industry. For example,\nsearch engines at Yelp (crowd-sourced business reviews)\nuse Elasticsearch (Dangat, 2017). Furthermore, Elasticsearch\nwas chosen as one of the databases as the developers had\nsome expertise and knowledge in using it in the Singapore\nArmed Forces Web Intelligence for counter-terrorism (Ng,\nSharma, Loke, & Lee, 2020).\n\nWhenever a piece of text is ingested into Elasticsearch,\nanalysers which make use of Natural Language Processing\ntechniques are applied to them, and this makes the\ntext searchable. Furthermore, Elasticsearch is able to\nperform fuzzy searching, which addresses the spelling\ninconsistencies, and is able to perform relevance-based\nsearching such that search results are sorted according to\nits relevance to the query.\n\nGeo-Spatial Component\n\nThe Geo-spatial component was developed to help contact\ntracers analyse the geo-spatial trends and relationships\n\nwere developed, namely Heat Map Visualisation and\nSpatial-Temporal Analysis, and these are described in the\nsections below.\n\nHeat Map Visualisation"}

Heat mapping is a useful visualisation tool that plots the\ndensity of visits by positive cases to an area and provides the\nteam with additional information. The application was able to\nidentify high-risk locations where transmission was prevalent.\nCases were plotted against known clusters and confirmed\ncases to identify the possibility of exposure to existing clusters.\nThis helped contact tracers identify potential location clusters\nsuch as supermarkets and eating places which were high-risk\nfocal points for transmissions. This approach also helped to\nverify the centrality analysis on the network database where\nmultiple cases were centrally linked by common location\nnodes. This information aided policy makers in making data-\ndriven decisions to control the transmission in such places.\n\n\n56 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\fSpatial-Temporal Analysis\n\nTo identify potential high-risk areas where transmission\n\nbetween cases was likely to occur, the users wanted to find\n\nlocations where there were frequent interactions. The spatial-\n\ntemporal application allows the users to filter positive cases\n\nin proximity with each other over a time span. Its objective\n\nwas to uncover overlapping visits across locations and time.\n\nLocations visited by cases were converted to latitude and\n\nlongitude coordinates and plotted onto the map. Matches\n\nwere flagged out when the haversine distance between a pair\n\nof coordinates was within a threshold proximity and fell within\n\na specified time window.

Data fusion also helped in\ngenerating richer datasets for analysis. An example was\nwhen the team wanted to be more thorough in the analysis\nof the locations where a case visited. There could be a\nlapse in memory in the individual\u2019s account of where he\nvisited or he could have unknowingly interacting with other\npeople in the vicinity. To this end, the pipeline expanded\nthe COVID-19 dataset by fusing each location postal code\nwith its nearby postal codes. This allowed the analysis to\nhave a more comprehensive picture of where the cases\nmight have visited.\n\nDEPLOYING FOR OPERATION\n\nIn early April 2020, the first prototype was deployed for field\ntrial after just one week of development. To validate the tool,\nthe team compared the results against previously identified\nand confirmed links involving several cases that had visited\nlocations such as Mustafa Centre in Little India, the Project\nGlory construction site and migrant worker dormitories. The\ntool substantiated the findings and additionally found more\ncases connected to the clusters. Subsequently, new cases\nwere linked to the mall (Mustafa Centre) to the construction\nsites and dormitories, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness\nof the first prototype.\n\nDuring its initial use, the early prototype successfully resolved\nmultiple unlinked cases and also identified new clusters at the\nMarina Bay Sands and massage parlours in the East Coast. It\nalso associated new cases to the initial Mustafa Centre cluster\nin Little India.\n\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\n57\n\fLESSONS LEARNT\nWorking Alongside Users\n\nThe key to delivering a working tool quickly in a fast-paced and\never-changing environment was for the software development\nteam in DSTA to work closely alongside operational users at\nMOH. This close relationship exemplified the importance of\nops-tech integration. The developers and epidemiology teams\nwere stationed physically at the same place, and the constant\ncommunication between the users and the developers allowed\nthe entire team to be aware of what everyone else was doing. It\naccelerated the speed of development. An example was when\noverlapping data requirements for different analysis required\nby the epidemiology teams were quickly sieved out which\nreduced the duplication of efforts. Development was also sped\nup through constant data clarifications with the ops team, and\nthis led to fast development of the data processing pipeline to\nform a single source of truth.\n\nEstablishing Quick Feedback Loops\n\nOne major challenge was the evolving situation where\npolicies and requirements were changing by the day, and\ntherefore forcing the models to adapt in parallel. Agile\ndevelopment was practised in order to keep pace with the\nchanging environment. Once a certain feature of the tool\nwas ready, it was deployed immediately to complement\nthe existing contact tracing workflow in order to get early\nfeedback. Bugs and fixes were addressed immediately and\nredeployed in the next sprint. This methodology allowed the\ntech team to prioritise the development tasks with the ops\nteam, to ensure that the tool remained relevant and useful in\na rapidly evolving situation."}

To screen people for fever, while commercially off-the-shelf contactless thermometers were\navailable, they were not automated and required manpower to conduct individual temperature screening at entry points to\nbuildings. The Infrared Fever Screening System (IFss) on the other hand, was employed for mass temperature screening\nduring the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2003, had a large deployment footprint and was much more\ncostly than contactless thermometers. To overcome these challenges and allow individuals to check their temperatures\neasily, DSTA worked with the Ministry of Culture, Community & Youth, Land Transport Authority and industry partners\nto develop the Temperature Self-Check Kiosk (TSCK). The TSCK was accurate, 70% cheaper than the IFss, had a small\ndeployment footprint and was easy to use. They were placed at train stations and bus interchanges and deployed at Army\ncamps to facilitate temperature checks.

QUESTION : {Model to insert question}, \nANSWER: {Model to insert answer} \nText :\n60 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\nIn developing the Temperature Self-Check Kiosk (TSCKk),\nthe team had the following considerations: (1) user centricity\nin system design and development, (2) need for accurate\nmeasurement of physiological body temperature, (3) data-\ndriven approach towards setting the fever detection threshold,\nand (4) ease of system deployment.\n\fSYSTEM DESIGN AND\nDEVELOPMENT CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe design concept behind the TSCK was for an easily\ndeployed, fast and contactless means of determining\nif a subject was potentially febrile! by sensing the skin\ntemperature. The TSCK was to serve as the first layer in the\ntemperature screening process, for subjects to be flagged as\npotentially febrile for subsequent confirmation of a fever with\na clinical thermometer.\n\nDesign thinking was applied throughout the development\nprocess to ensure that the system\u2019s design goals were met.\nThe first prototypes were developed within two weeks, and\nconsisted primarily of infrared sensors sensitive specifically\nto the range of temperatures between 30-40\u00b0C, with visual\n\nThe prototypes had to be calibrated so that they could detect\npotentially febrile persons. To calibrate the prototypes, data\ncollection for febrile and non-febrile subjects was necessary.\nWhile data collection was ongoing, the team also deployed\nthe prototypes at public areas, such as MRT stations and bus\nto observe whether the system design was intuitive to first-time\nusers and to gather valuable feedback on the product design.\nSome of the feedback pointed to the light-emitting diode (LED)\nindicators being too small and not prominent enough; while\nothers highlighted that they would want to see a temperature\nreadout. It was observed that people tended to stand too\nclose to the TSCK, as they were used to commercial handheld\ninfrared thermometers, which had an operational range of\nfive centimetres. Hardware and software changes based on\nthe feedback and observations were implemented iteratively\nin the improved versions of the prototypes. For example, a\nproximity sensor was included in the final system design to\nenable temperature readings only when users were standing\nat a correct distance from the sensor. This reduced user error\nwhen taking temperature measurements.\n\nNote: Feedback for the device on the left in was in the form of a LED light bar while feedback for the device on the right in was in the form of a\ncoloured display as well as words indicating if the user had a fever or not.\n\nReprinted with permission from The Singapore Army (left image)\n\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\n61\n\fApart from being user-friendly, it was also important for the\nTSCK to maintain its accuracy, repeatability over different\nambient conditions and temperature stability over time. For\none of the prototypes, a proprietary solution was engineered\nand implemented to ensure that the TSCK could maintain its\ntemperature reading stably without the need for a blackbody\nreference heat source at different pre-set temperatures to verify\nthe system\u2019s accuracy and stability over an extended period of\ntime. The temperature drifted over an extended period of time\nfor one of the prototypes was found to be less than +/- 0.04\u00b0C\nfrom the mean value.\n\n\nHUMAN PHYSIOLOGICAL\nCONSIDERATIONS\n\nSkin Versus Core Temperature"}

QUESTION : {Model to insert question}, \nANSWER: {Model to insert answer} \nText :\nHUMAN PHYSIOLOGICAL\nCONSIDERATIONS\n\nSkin Versus Core Temperature\n\nThe core or internal body temperature is generally considered\nto be the temperature of the blood in the heart and the\nbrain. However, this is not easily measured, unless an\ninvasive catheter is inserted. Therefore, other body sites are\ntypically used as proxies to assess human core temperature\n(American Society for Testing and Materials, 2003). There\nare four common methods for the measurement of the core\nbody temperature (McCallum & Higgins, 2012): (1) rectal\nthermometer, (2) oral thermometer, (3) ear thermometer, and\n(4) axillary (armpit) temperature. Methods 1 to 3 provide\naccurate measurements of the core body temperature, while\n\n62 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\nmethod 4 is an unreliable site (Sund-Levander & Grodzinsky,\n2009) for estimating core body temperature due to the\nabsence of main blood vessels around the area. However, all\nfour methods require contact with the body. For contactless\nmeans, measurements of the skin temperature are primarily\nused as a gauge of core body temperature.\n\nEmpirical data collected has shown that there is no independent\ncorrelation between skin temperature and the core body\ntemperature of a person. Skin temperatures are also found to\nbe easily affected by ambient conditions (Liu, Wang, Liu & Di,\n2013) and fluctuate across different times of the day (Morf &\nSchibler, 2013), with the highest at between 4pm to 6pm and\nlowest in the early morning.\n\nAs the TSCK was a newly-designed system, there was a need\nto determine the most suitable temperature threshold for fever\nas measured by the TSCK. While the Infrared Fever Screening\nSystem (IFss) had collected data during its development\nin 2003, these were not applicable to the TSCK for two\nreasons. First, as the TSCK used a different infrared sensor\nfrom the IFss, it was therefore important to collect fresh data\nto characterise the TSCK\u2019s sensors accurately and ensure its\nefficacy. Second, the TSCK was meant for individual use and,\nhence, had a much shorter measuring distance compared\nto the IFss used for screening larger groups at a further\ndistance. The team adopted a data-driven approach, using\nthe methodology published in the Society of Photo-Optical\nInstrumentation Engineers proceedings (Tan, Teo, Ong & Tan,\n2004) from the development of the IFss, to collect temperature\nmeasurements from both healthy and febrile populations and\nestablish the threshold at which to detect febrile persons.\n\nMETHODOLOGY FOR THRESHOLD\nSETTING\n\nThe threshold setting of the TSCK is the level that is used to\nindicate to the user if they might have a fever. The aim was\nto derive a linear classifier to categorise a subject undergoing\nscreening into either a febrile or healthy class based on the\nsubject\u2019s skin temperature, while minimising the impact of\nerrors. There are two types of errors: Type | error - a false\npositive result in which a healthy subject is classified as febrile;\nand Type Il error - a false negative result in which a febrile\nsubject is classified as healthy.\n\nTwo sets of data are required to determine the threshold setting:\n(1) the core and skin temperature of a healthy population,\nand (2) the core and skin temperature of a febrile population.\n\fA JOURNEY OF INNOVATION - DEVELOPING A ROBUST AND ACCURATE TEMPERATURE SELF-CHECK KIOSK"}

A febrile subject is defined as\nhaving a core temperature of equal to or more than 38\u00b0C.\n\nThe data collected was then plotted to understand the\ndistribution of skin temperature of healthy and_ febrile\nthe healthy population and the red curve represents the febrile\npopulation. The black line in the plot represents the threshold\nthat was being defined based on the data collected. The blue\nshaded area in the curve represents the false positive errors,\nwhich means healthy subjects were being misclassified as\nfebrile subjects. The pink shaded area represents the false\nnegative errors, which means febrile subjects were being\nmisclassified as healthy subjects. The threshold setting was\ntherefore a trade-off between the proportion of false positive\nand false negative errors. For example, if the black line was\nshifted to the left, the false negative percentage would decrease\nwhile the false positive percentage increased. In the ideal\nscenario, the two sets of data would have minimal overlap,\nsuch that the shaded blue and pink regions could be minimised\nwith a given threshold. In reality, however, the two sets of data\nhad significant overlap, thus making it impossible to reduce\neither the false positive or false negative without increasing the\nother. Given that false negative was less desirable compared\nto false positive, the threshold for the TSCK was optimised for\nan acceptable ratio of false negative to false positive errors,\nbased on risk tolerance level and deployment scenario.\n\nNote: The data points are generalised and smoothened into a curve\nfor illustration.\n\n\nProcess of Data Collection\n\nFebrile data collection trials were conducted in medical\nfacilities, including hospital and private clinics, to collect the\n6-8 for the data collection process. The TSCK prototypes\nwere set up in similar air-conditioned environments. The core\ntemperature of each patient would first be measured using the\nclinic\u2019s tympanic thermometer. For measurement consistency,\nthe same tympanic thermometer was used throughout the trial.\nThe patient was then directed to the prototypes to measure\nhis/her skin temperature. Visual markers were placed on the\nfloor and on the prototype to guide the patients on where\nto stand and use the prototype. Personnel were also on site\nto record the temperature measurements and observe the\npatient\u2019s behaviour when using the prototypes.\n\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\n\n63\n\fHealthy data collection trials were subsequently conducted\nusing the TSCK prototypes. The prototypes were set up in\nair-conditioned environments similar to those used for febrile\ndata collection. The core temperature of each subject was\nmeasured using a tympanic thermometer, followed by his or\nher skin temperature using the prototypes.\n\n\nSetting the Threshold Temperature\n\nA non-parametric distribution fitting (histogram) was used to\ndetermine the threshold temperature as the febrile patient data\nused to assess the threshold setting of a prototype. The vertical\nblack dotted line represents the threshold setting. In these\nparticular examples, a threshold setting at 33.8\u00b0C would give a\n48.3% false positive and 5.0% false negative while a threshold\nsetting of 34.6\u00b0C would result in a 1.9% false positive and a\n27.5% false negative. Therefore, it can be seen that there will\nalways be a trade-off in choosing a low false negative number\nwhich will result in a high false positive number and vice versa.\n\nSYSTEM DEPLOYMENT\nCONSIDERATIONS"}

A person flagged\nout as potentially febrile by the TSCK should use a clinical\nthermometer to confirm his or her temperature. As such\nsystems were expected to be operated continuously for long\nperiods, regular maintenance and technical support would\nhave to be planned accordingly to ensure high availability and\nease of maintenance.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe TSCK was designed to provide a quick and contactless\nmeans to determine if a subject was potentially febrile by\nsensing the facial skin temperature. Using a data-driven\napproach, the threshold temperature setting for fever was\n\nstatistically determined based on the healthy and febrile data\ncollected through trials, with associated trade-offs in false\npositive and false negative errors.\n\nThe team eventually selected the temperature self-check\nsystem of local firm HOPE Technik for production. The first\nsystem was deployed at MINDEF Pass Office on 23 April 2020.\nThe systems were subsequently deployed at MRT stations,\nbus interchanges and other Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)\ncamps. This has reduced the reliance on the IFss as well as\nenabled deployment of the TSCK in areas which are spatially\nconstrained, saving manpower for the SAF by removing the\nneed to man the TSCK.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe authors would like to thank the hospital and private clinics\nwhich hosted our trials; our volunteers who took part in the\ntrials, as well as our partners Ministry of Culture, Community\n& Youth, Land Transport Authority and the SAF, for their\nunwavering support.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nASTM International.
