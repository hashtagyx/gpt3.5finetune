Having a single integrated C3 system fundamentally transformed the way agencies collaborated with one another by breaking down operational silos. (2) Significantly Quicken End-to-end Response Time - Using multiple systems slowed down response time because information had to be duplicated and transferred across systems. All parties now accessed and worked on the same system and used a common source of information without having to rely on personal applications like WhatsApp or emails. (3) Scalable and Minimize Waste - With a generic C3 platform, the development teams would not need to recreate the same features repeatedly in C3 systems for each agency. Instead, they could build on the generic platform to develop bespoke functions by creating the dedicated applications required by different agencies. This helped to streamline and minimize the overall effort."}]}
