{"question": "What was the problem with multiple action parties working on incidents?", "answer": "The team observed that multiple action parties were involved when working on incidents. Even if the incident was under the jurisdiction of one specific agency, people from various departments would have to work together. There was no single integrated system that could be used."}
{"question": "Why is more training required for users of disparate systems?", "answer": "Although users do not necessarily need to manage large-scale events frequently, they still needed to manage daily operations that required coordination and collaboration with different parties. Should an incident escalate into a major event, these users would be required to be familiar with their systems in order to respond quickly to the event. However, users have various systems with different operating procedures for different types of scenarios. This led to frequent training to familiarize themselves with systems to prevent deskilling."}
{"question": "What goals did the team aim to achieve with the generic C3 system?", "answer": "The team aimed to achieve the following goals with the generic C3 system: (1) Integrated C3 System - Users across agencies did not have access to C3 systems when they needed to respond to incidents, and when they did, they had to work with disparate systems. Having a single integrated C3 system fundamentally transformed the way agencies collaborated with one another by breaking down operational silos. (2) Significantly Quicken End-to-end Response Time - Using multiple systems slowed down response time because information had to be duplicated and transferred across systems. All parties now accessed and worked on the same system and used a common source of information without having to rely on personal applications like WhatsApp or emails. (3) Scalable and Minimize Waste - With a generic C3 platform, the development teams would not need to recreate the same features repeatedly in C3 systems for each agency. Instead, they could build on the generic platform to develop bespoke functions by creating the dedicated applications required by different agencies. This helped to streamline and minimize the overall effort."}
{"question": "How did the team demonstrate how the solution worked?", "answer": "To demonstrate how the solution worked, the team created a video storyboard depicting a counter-terrorism scenario and how users should use the system to respond to the incident. Before the video production started, the team created scripts from the concept video."}
{"question": "What did the users provide feedback on?", "answer": "The video was presented to various user groups to obtain feedback on improvements and specific applications that they would need. The users were better able to articulate their needs because they understood how they would coordinate with other agencies and the specific apps they would need to fill any operational gaps."}
{"question": "What happened when the system went on trial during Singapore's National Day Parade in 2019?", "answer": "The system went on trial during Singapore\u2019s National Day Parade in 2019 and has since been adapted as a baseline for other C3 systems."}
