It can be seen as an integrated approach that comprises four elements - People, Process, Methods and\\nPrinciples. User Experience (UX) encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interactions with an organisation, its services\\nand products. In DSTA, DI and UX are combined for strategic impact and organisational transformation while enhancing\\nuser experience and satisfaction in the solutions it creates for defence and national security. This article describes the\\nimportance of DI and UX (collectively referred to as DI-UX) and discusses its application in the organisation and the design\\nof an integrated Command, Control and Communication System.\\n\\nKeywords: design innovation, transformation strategy, design methodology, user experience, user-centric design\\n\\n \\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nWe live in a world that is perpetually changing, one that is\\nfraught with complex challenges and uncertainties. The ever-\\nevolving threat landscape and technological climate today\\nmeans that the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) will need to\\nrapidly innovate and transform the way in which wars are\\nfought in the digital age to maintain a technology edge over\\nits adversaries.\\n\\nSingapore’s declining citizen population is another immutable\\nchallenge that the SAF will need to tackle. With up to 30%\\nfewer National Servicemen by 2030 (Ng, 2016), any technology\\ndeveloped for the SAF must not only be manpower-efficient,\\nbut also intuitive to use.\\n\\nThe need for enhanced user experience (UX) in our solutions is\\neven more important as the younger generation of SAF soldiers\\nare accustomed to the latest technology and interactive\\ndevices. As leading consumers of technology in the future\\n(Ostermeier, 2021), UX can no longer be an afterthought, but\\nwill be an increasing necessity in military solutions.\\n\\n4 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\nTHE DSTA DESIGN JOURNEY\\n\\nAs a statutory board under the Ministry of Defence, DSTA\\nis responsible for delivering technological solutions to the\\nSAF. The nature of work in DSTA spans a wide spectrum to\\nensure that the SAF continues to be a formidable fighting\\nforce. In light of the changing threat landscape and increasing\\nexpectations for superior UX in our solutions, DSTA has\\ninvested heavily in developing Design Innovation (Dl) and UX\\ncapabilities since 2015.\\n\\nThe goal of Dl is to tackle complex problems using the mindset\\nand approach of a designer. It is a user-centric methodology for\\nsystematic innovation, and aims to find the right solutions that\\nwill create the desired results for the right problem. DI acts as\\na Catalyst to effect innovative, user-centric and future-oriented\\nthinking to drive enterprise-level transformation. It emphasises\\nempathy, which is a key skill to enable deep understanding of\\nusers, opens up opportunities in their business objectives and\\nmissions, and consequently informs how technologies can be\\nbetter designed to deliver real value and impact.\\n\\x0cUX aims to create frictionless and desirable experience in all\\naspects of the end-user’s interaction with products, services\\nand systems. The increase in expectations for good UX and the\\ngradual reduction of manpower has driven the need for DSTA\\nto raise the bar of design quality. Together, DI and UX design\\naims to deliver impactful solutions with delightful experience.\\n\\nSeeding the DI Culture'}, {'question_id': 4, 'text': 'Based on the text, generate 10 different question and answer pairs.\\nText:\\n\\nSeeding the DI Culture\\n\\nDSTA began seeding a culture of DI within the organisation with\\na series of initiatives to equip staff with DI knowledge and skills\\nthrough a strategic partnership with the Singapore University\\nof Technology and Design (SUTD), more specifically, the\\nSUTD-MIT International Design Centre (IDC). The partnership\\n(DesignSingapore Council, 2020) resulted in a bespoke DI\\nCourse co-designed by both partners to train DSTA engineers\\nwith DI skills simultaneously while working on high priority\\nprojects. Depending on the area of application, DI course\\noutcomes typically ranged from solution proposals in the form\\nof digital products, to policy changes and services provided.\\n\\nWith its commencement in 2015, the DI course focused\\non two key objectives: (1) to develop engineers with\\nfoundational DI mindsets, principles and methods; and (2)\\nto enhance understanding through application of DI on real\\ntopics and projects. This collaboration combined DSTA’s\\nstrength in systems engineering and SUTD-IDC’s expertise\\nin taking a human-centred multidisciplinary approach to\\nengineering design.\\n\\nDesigning the DI Course\\n\\nDuration, Format and Structure\\n\\nEvery run of the course conducted was improved from the\\npreceding run based on participant feedback. Beginning with\\na two-day workshop that grew into a three-day bootcamp,\\nthe course duration was eventually expanded from 12 to 15\\nweeks and incorporated multiple opportunities for project\\nconsultation with SUTD and DSTA DI experts (e.g. framing\\nworkshop to help teams frame and strategise their approach,\\nsprint consultations, experiential wall reviews, etc.). At the end\\nof the course, a final presentation would be made to DSTA’s\\nsenior management where participating teams showcased\\ntheir innovations and solutions for their project topics. With\\nsupport from management, the proposals for the project\\nwould subsequently be pursued by the respective programme\\n\\ncentres (PCs), and the presentation archived as case studies\\n‘or future sharing.\\n\\nTopic Curation and Team Formation\\n\\nThe approach to curating topics was also adjusted over the\\nyears as DI maturity in the organisation grew. During the\\n‘ormative years of the DI course, participants would scope\\nout slices of their existing projects to apply DI. However,\\nleading impactful change in capability development required\\nexperience and expertise from multiple disciplines, thereby\\ndriving the need to change how teams were formed, both in\\ncomposition and in size. This resulted in a progressive elevation\\nrom applying DI at a project-level to the enterprise-level,\\nwhere senior leadership would take on the role as “domain\\nchampions” to identify crucial and high impact challenges to\\nSAF and DSTA.

For\\nexample, some stakeholders sought risk-free solutions, while\\nothers were unwilling to change workflows and processes.\\nThis unwillingness to deviate from established norms was\\nalso observed in some teams as some of them felt that they\\nwere not senior enough to effect change.\\n\\nDesign Processes, Systems and\\nInfrastructure\"}, {'question_id': 6, 'text': \"Based on the text, generate 10 different question and answer pairs.\\nText:\\n\\nDesign Processes, Systems and\\nInfrastructure\\n\\nIt was observed that the full design process was usually too\\ntedious to execute because of two main reasons. First, Dl\\nand UX activities were mostly executed manually, generating\\nphysical design artefacts in the process. Practitioners faced\\nhigh barriers in digitising these artefacts due to additional\\nefforts required to do so. Second, design templates or UX\\npatterns were not standardised across the organisation, and\\nindividuals had to create their own.\\n\\nInitiatives\\n\\nThese challenges compelled DSTA to reorganise DI-UX at\\nthe organisation level. The DI-UX Team is presently exploring\\nvarious ways to address challenges associated with resource\\nand skillset limitation.\\n\\nFirst, UX support will be progressively scaled up across PCs.\\nSecond, DI fireside activities will continue to be conducted to\\nimbue the right mindsets and knowledge sharing to strengthen\\nthe overall culture of DI among staff. This is to address the\\ngeneral lack of confidence in applying DI. Third, the DI-UX Team\\nhas also developed a DI Operations Playbook with templates\\nto streamline design processes across the organisation. This\\nwill eliminate the need for additional efforts from individual\\nPCs to create separate templates. To enable consistent design\\nquality and practices across the organisation, the team has\\nalso built a design system containing reusable patterns for\\ndigital systems.\\n\\nDI-UX APPLICATION IN THE\\nINTEGRATED C3 SYSTEM\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nThe integrated Command, Control and Communication\\n(C3) System was envisaged to be a platform for multiple\\ngovernment agencies to command, control and communicate\\nwhen managing and responding to incidents in large-scale\\nevents, such as the Singapore's National Day Parade.\\n\\nDI Methodology\\n\\nThe team began with the discovery of the problem space\\nwithin a few agencies in the public sector. User research\\nwas conducted over seven months, with over 100 users\\nfrom 40 operational units across four government ministries,\\nto understand their respective operations, work processes\\nand challenges. Research methods included user interviews,\\nfocus groups, in-situ observations, ideation methods and\\ndesign critiques. The research informed three key persons\\ninvolved in the management of large-scale events: Decision\\nMaker, Coordinating Officer and Ground Officer. To facilitate\\ndeeper conversations with the users and stakeholders, several\\nversions of C3 prototypes were created in varying fidelity and\\nshared with them for their feedback.\\n\\nDiscovering and Defining the Problem\\nSpace\\n\\nSome of the key opportunities and insights gained from the\\nuser research were as follows:\\n\\n(1) No Access to C3 When Needed As Users Were Always\\non the Move - Many of the C3 systems were housed only\\n\\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\x0c(2)\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nin operation centres at different locations. Users had to\\nvisit these operation centres and log in to terminals before\\nthey could access the C3 systems. This hindered users\\nwho were frequently on the move.\\n\\nUsers Rely on WhatsApp and Emails — A number of users\\ndid not have access to the C3 systems. Yet, they were still\\ncalled on to contribute to the operations, and they had to\\nrely on personal applications like WhatsApp and emails.\\nHowever, WhatsApp was not designed for C3 operations,\\nand users often became lost in the large volume of\\nmessages. Sensemaking and locating relevant information\\nbecame a major challenge in large-scale missions where\\nmultiple groups and agencies had to work together. The\\nchallenge was exacerbated by having to port information\\nover to multiple applications.\"}, {'question_id': 7, 'text': 'Based on the text, generate 10 different question and answer pairs.\\nText:\\n\\nMultiple Action Parties Lacking a Common Platform to\\nFacilitate Coordination —- The team observed that multiple\\naction parties were involved when working on incidents.\\nEven if the incident was under the jurisdiction of one\\nspecific agency, people from various departments would\\nhave to work together. There was no single integrated\\nsystem that could be used.\\n\\n(4) Disparate Systems in Peace Time and Crisis Means\\nMore Training is Required to Prevent Deskilling -\\nAlthough users do not necessarily need to manage large-\\nscale events frequently, they still needed to manage daily\\noperations that required coordination and collaboration\\nwith different parties. Should an incident escalate into a\\nmajor event, these users would be required to be familiar\\nwith their systems in order to respond quickly to the\\nevent. However, users have various systems with different\\noperating procedures for different types of scenarios.\\nThis led to frequent training to familiarise themselves with\\nsystems to prevent deskilling.\\n\\nDeveloping and Delivering the Proposed\\nSolution\\n\\nSeveral versions of the prototypes were created through the\\nthe key screens designed for the core functions.\\n\\n8 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\x0cNURTURING A DESIGN INNOVATION AND USER EXPERIENCE CULTURE IN DSTA\\n\\n\\nThe prototype went through many iterations with the various\\nagencies on multiple tracks of design and development. Every\\nnew insight from each iteration contributed to the product\\nimprovement. Based on insights gained, the team designed a\\ngeneric C3 system that achieved the following goals:\\n\\n(1) Integrated C3 System - As mentioned earlier, users\\nacross agencies did not have access to C3 systems when\\nthey needed to respond to incidents, and when they did,\\nthey had to work with disparate systems. Having a single\\nintegrated C3 system fundamentally transformed the way\\nagencies collaborated with one another by breaking down\\noperational silos.\\n\\n(2) Significantly Quicken End-to-end Response Time\\n- Using multiple systems slowed down response time\\nbecause information had to be duplicated and transferred\\nacross systems. All parties now accessed and worked\\non the same system and used a common source of\\ninformation without having to rely on personal applications\\nlike WhatsApp or emails.\\n\\n(3) Scalable and Minimise Waste - With a generic C3\\nplatform, the development teams would not need to\\nrecreate the same features repeatedly in C3 systems for\\neach agency. Instead, they could build on the generic\\nplatform to develop bespoke functions by creating the\\ndedicated applications required by different agencies. This\\nhelped to streamline and minimise the overall effort.\\n\\nTo demonstrate how the solution worked, the team created a\\nvideo storyboard depicting a counter-terrorism scenario and\\nhow users should use the system to respond to the incident.\\nBefore the video production started, the team created scripts\\nfrom the concept video.\\n\\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\n9\\n\\x0cUser Feedback\\n\\nThe video was presented to various user groups to obtain\\nfeedback on improvements, and specific applications that\\nthey would need. The users were better able to articulate their\\nneeds because they understood how they would coordinate\\nwith other agencies, and the specific apps they would need to\\nfill any operational gaps.\\n\\nThe users were encouraged by the design and could see\\nthe value of the system. Others were excited by the new\\n\\n10 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\ncapabilities and potential use cases that they could apply to\\ntheir own agencies.\\n\\nThe system went on trial during Singapore’s National Day\\nParade in 2019, and has since been adapted as a baseline for\\n\\nother C3 systems.\\n\\nSystem at a glance.\\n\\n\\n\\x0cNURTURING A DESIGN INNOVATION AND USER EXPERIENCE CULTURE IN DSTA\\n\\nCONCLUSION'}, {'question_id': 8, 'text': 'Based on the text, generate 10 different question and answer pairs.\\nText:\\n\\nThe system went on trial during Singapore’s National Day\\nParade in 2019, and has since been adapted as a baseline for\\n\\nother C3 systems.\\n\\nSystem at a glance.\\n\\n\\n\\x0cNURTURING A DESIGN INNOVATION AND USER EXPERIENCE CULTURE IN DSTA\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nDSTA has come a long way in her design journey.

These OT systems are\\ncommonly found in the transport, energy, water and defence\\n\\nMany may not be aware that OT systems are present in\\nour everyday lives and drive the way we function and work.\\nHowever, these systems are not designed with cybersecurity\\nin mind, as the focus is on functionality and availability. This\\nmakes them attractive targets of cyberattacks, which can\\ncause high mission impact, bring disruption to lives and result\\nin financial losses. One of the most significant attacks was\\nthe Stuxnet event, a cyberattack which caused physical and\\nirreversible damage to the centrifuges in lran’s nuclear plants.\\n\\n\\n12 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\x0cRecognising the increasing use of cyber means to disrupt OT\\nsystems, DSTA embarked on a journey to develop an approach\\nto address the new needs brought about by the convergence\\nof the Information Technology (IT) and OT spaces to achieve\\nnew capabilities and productivity. The two key enablers to\\nsecure OT were identified to be architecture standardisation\\nand competency development. In the defence context, OT\\ncomprises control systems on ships or aircraft, data links and\\nbuilding control systems. The focus of this article is on building\\ncontrol systems, which are becoming increasingly digitalised\\nwith remote monitoring and control capabilities. The article\\naims to describe DSTA’s journey in developing the two key\\nenablers, as well as identifying future efforts and priorities.\\n\\nWHAT ARE INDUSTRIAL CONTROL\\nSYSTEMS?\\n\\nAn Industrial Control System (ICS) is a subset of OT systems.\\nIt is a combination of control components (e.g. electrical,\\nmechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic) that act together to facilitate\\ndetection and maintain control of physical operations through\\ndata acquisition, visualisation and controls. They play a critical\\n\\nrole in maintaining continuous operations, as well as ensuring\\nfunctional and technical safety in the prevention of accidents\\nand disasters.\\n\\nICS includes Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\\n(SCADA)! systems, Distributed Control Systems?, and other\\ncontrol system configurations such as Programmable Logic\\nand connectivity of an ICS. They are typically deployed for\\nmonitoring and/or the control of building related services\\ndistribution such as power, water and fuel, cooling, mechanised\\nequipment and physical security.\"}, {'question_id': 10, 'text': 'Based on the text, generate 10 different question and answer pairs.\\nText:\\n\\nICS includes Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\\n(SCADA)! systems, Distributed Control Systems?, and other\\ncontrol system configurations such as Programmable Logic\\nand connectivity of an ICS. They are typically deployed for\\nmonitoring and/or the control of building related services\\ndistribution such as power, water and fuel, cooling, mechanised\\nequipment and physical security.\\n\\nwhich are analogue devices used to monitor and measure\\nthe telemetry of equipment such as the rotational speed of a\\ngenerator. The sensors will interpret the readings and report\\nback a change of state. Actuators are used to execute the\\ncontrols via a change of contact point (ON or OFF state).\\nPLCs are embedded devices that are pre-programmed with\\nalgorithms known as ladder logic. The role of the PLC is to\\ncompare the inputs received from the sensors against a pre-\\n\\n\\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\n13\\n\\x0cset threshold. When there are deviations, the PLC will issue the\\nnecessary control signals to the actuators to bring the system\\nback to the ideal state. The PLC is also the interface with the IT\\nserver, and will be able to receive overriding commands from\\nthe server to change the pre-set threshold. Remote Terminal\\nUnits are used to interface multiple PLCs to the server, and\\nhandle the interface and translation of ICS protocols, for\\nexample Serial to Ethernet.\\n\\nInterface (HMI), servers and networking equipment to monitor\\nand control the entire ICS system. The HMI is generally the\\npresents information to the operator. The HMI may also accept\\ncontrol instructions from the operator and sends it to the\\nserver for processing. The ICS servers will poll the status of\\nthe systems periodically and present the information on the\\nHMI workstation. It will also receive the control instructions\\nfrom the HMI and send the commands to the field device to\\nactivate the control process. The Historian is the database that\\nkeeps tracks of all systems status and commands for fault\\ntroubleshooting purposes.\\n\\nEVOLUTION OF INDUSTRIAL\\nCONTROL SYSTEMS\\n\\nEarly versions of ICS started with little automation and\\ndigitalisation. Many of the control and monitoring functions\\nused to be done locally with hard-wired relays and timers\\ncoupled with man-in-the-loop processes. As time progressed,\\nthe push for automation and enhacement to productivity led to\\nthe development of remote monitoring and control capabilities.\\n\\nWhen these systems and capabilities were developed in the\\n1970s, they were based on an air-gapped and standalone\\nconcepts, with vendor or Original Equipment Manufacturer\\nspecific components and protocols. The focus of the ICS\\ndeveloper and users then was on availability and safety, with\\nscant consideration for security. In fact, the main security\\nfeature was physical security, by keeping these devices behind\\nlocked gates and security guards. This has been the industry\\npractice for the last 30 years.\\n\\nIn the early 2000s, ICS started to shift from the use of\\nproprietary computing and communications to adopting\\ncommon industrial standards and open protocols which made\\nthem more “IT-like”. Yet, the mindset on how these systems\\nwere used and designed did not change. Engineering teams\\nmanaging these systems had little or no security awareness and\\n\\n14 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\ncontinued to rely on standalone designs and physical access\\ncontrol measures to protect these systems. The industry was\\nalso not well prepared to support new digital models of ICS\\nand was slow to apply IT security best practices. This resulted\\nin fundamental security gaps and resulted in several critical\\nICS becoming targets of cyberattacks.\\n\\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE'}]\n"
