It can be seen as an integrated approach that comprises four elements - People, Process, Methods and\\nPrinciples. User Experience (UX) encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interactions with an organisation, its services\\nand products. In DSTA, DI and UX are combined for strategic impact and organisational transformation while enhancing\\nuser experience and satisfaction in the solutions it creates for defence and national security. This article describes the\\nimportance of DI and UX (collectively referred to as DI-UX) and discusses its application in the organisation and the design\\nof an integrated Command, Control and Communication System.\\n\\nKeywords: design innovation, transformation strategy, design methodology, user experience, user-centric design\\n\\n \\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nWe live in a world that is perpetually changing, one that is\\nfraught with complex challenges and uncertainties. The ever-\\nevolving threat landscape and technological climate today\\nmeans that the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) will need to\\nrapidly innovate and transform the way in which wars are\\nfought in the digital age to maintain a technology edge over\\nits adversaries.\\n\\nSingapore’s declining citizen population is another immutable\\nchallenge that the SAF will need to tackle. With up to 30%\\nfewer National Servicemen by 2030 (Ng, 2016), any technology\\ndeveloped for the SAF must not only be manpower-efficient,\\nbut also intuitive to use.\\n\\nThe need for enhanced user experience (UX) in our solutions is\\neven more important as the younger generation of SAF soldiers\\nare accustomed to the latest technology and interactive\\ndevices. As leading consumers of technology in the future\\n(Ostermeier, 2021), UX can no longer be an afterthought, but\\nwill be an increasing necessity in military solutions.\\n\\n4 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\nTHE DSTA DESIGN JOURNEY\\n\\nAs a statutory board under the Ministry of Defence, DSTA\\nis responsible for delivering technological solutions to the\\nSAF. The nature of work in DSTA spans a wide spectrum to\\nensure that the SAF continues to be a formidable fighting\\nforce. In light of the changing threat landscape and increasing\\nexpectations for superior UX in our solutions, DSTA has\\ninvested heavily in developing Design Innovation (Dl) and UX\\ncapabilities since 2015.\\n\\nThe goal of Dl is to tackle complex problems using the mindset\\nand approach of a designer. It is a user-centric methodology for\\nsystematic innovation, and aims to find the right solutions that\\nwill create the desired results for the right problem. DI acts as\\na Catalyst to effect innovative, user-centric and future-oriented\\nthinking to drive enterprise-level transformation. It emphasises\\nempathy, which is a key skill to enable deep understanding of\\nusers, opens up opportunities in their business objectives and\\nmissions, and consequently informs how technologies can be\\nbetter designed to deliver real value and impact.\\n\\x0cUX aims to create frictionless and desirable experience in all\\naspects of the end-user’s interaction with products, services\\nand systems. The increase in expectations for good UX and the\\ngradual reduction of manpower has driven the need for DSTA\\nto raise the bar of design quality. Together, DI and UX design\\naims to deliver impactful solutions with delightful experience.\\n\\nSeeding the DI Culture'},\n",

The partnership\\n(DesignSingapore Council, 2020) resulted in a bespoke DI\\nCourse co-designed by both partners to train DSTA engineers\\nwith DI skills simultaneously while working on high priority\\nprojects. Depending on the area of application, DI course\\noutcomes typically ranged from solution proposals in the form\\nof digital products, to policy changes and services provided.\\n\\nWith its commencement in 2015, the DI course focused\\non two key objectives: (1) to develop engineers with\\nfoundational DI mindsets, principles and methods; and (2)\\nto enhance understanding through application of DI on real\\ntopics and projects. This collaboration combined DSTA’s\\nstrength in systems engineering and SUTD-IDC’s expertise\\nin taking a human-centred multidisciplinary approach to\\nengineering design.\\n\\nDesigning the DI Course\\n\\nDuration, Format and Structure\\n\\nEvery run of the course conducted was improved from the\\npreceding run based on participant feedback. Beginning with\\na two-day workshop that grew into a three-day bootcamp,\\nthe course duration was eventually expanded from 12 to 15\\nweeks and incorporated multiple opportunities for project\\nconsultation with SUTD and DSTA DI experts (e.g. framing\\nworkshop to help teams frame and strategise their approach,\\nsprint consultations, experiential wall reviews, etc.). At the end\\nof the course, a final presentation would be made to DSTA’s\\nsenior management where participating teams showcased\\ntheir innovations and solutions for their project topics. With\\nsupport from management, the proposals for the project\\nwould subsequently be pursued by the respective programme\\n\\ncentres (PCs), and the presentation archived as case studies\\n‘or future sharing.\\n\\nTopic Curation and Team Formation\\n\\nThe approach to curating topics was also adjusted over the\\nyears as DI maturity in the organisation grew. During the\\n‘ormative years of the DI course, participants would scope\\nout slices of their existing projects to apply DI. However,\\nleading impactful change in capability development required\\nexperience and expertise from multiple disciplines, thereby\\ndriving the need to change how teams were formed, both in\\ncomposition and in size. This resulted in a progressive elevation\\nrom applying DI at a project-level to the enterprise-level,\\nwhere senior leadership would take on the role as “domain\\nchampions” to identify crucial and high impact challenges to\\nSAF and DSTA. These topics would then be undertaken by\\nparticipating teams from different PCs and corporate entities,\\nand in some cases, with users from the SAF.\\n\\n \\n\\nBenchmarking Progress in DI Culture\\n\\nOver the years, DSTA’s DI strategy continuously evolved\\nalongside advancements in the field, organisational needs and\\nstaff feedback.\\n\\nA user research study was conducted in 2019 with the course\\nparticipants holding appointments ranging from Engineers\\nto Head Capability Development to gain insights into their\\nexperience with their DI journeys. The research informed\\nthat the programme provided participants with learning\\nopportunities that were rare in their day-to-day work routines.\\nThe exposure opened their eyes to new possibilities that would\\notherwise have gone unnoticed, and allowed them to build on\\none another’s strengths in developing and creating innovative\\nsolutions. DI provided them with a common language\\nand platform for innovation and collaboration, even if they\\npossessed different skills with varying experience.'},\n",

First, Dl\\nand UX activities were mostly executed manually, generating\\nphysical design artefacts in the process. Practitioners faced\\nhigh barriers in digitising these artefacts due to additional\\nefforts required to do so. Second, design templates or UX\\npatterns were not standardised across the organisation, and\\nindividuals had to create their own.\\n\\nInitiatives\\n\\nThese challenges compelled DSTA to reorganise DI-UX at\\nthe organisation level. The DI-UX Team is presently exploring\\nvarious ways to address challenges associated with resource\\nand skillset limitation.\\n\\nFirst, UX support will be progressively scaled up across PCs.\\nSecond, DI fireside activities will continue to be conducted to\\nimbue the right mindsets and knowledge sharing to strengthen\\nthe overall culture of DI among staff. This is to address the\\ngeneral lack of confidence in applying DI. Third, the DI-UX Team\\nhas also developed a DI Operations Playbook with templates\\nto streamline design processes across the organisation. This\\nwill eliminate the need for additional efforts from individual\\nPCs to create separate templates. To enable consistent design\\nquality and practices across the organisation, the team has\\nalso built a design system containing reusable patterns for\\ndigital systems.\\n\\nDI-UX APPLICATION IN THE\\nINTEGRATED C3 SYSTEM\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nThe integrated Command, Control and Communication\\n(C3) System was envisaged to be a platform for multiple\\ngovernment agencies to command, control and communicate\\nwhen managing and responding to incidents in large-scale\\nevents, such as the Singapore's National Day Parade.\\n\\nDI Methodology\\n\\nThe team began with the discovery of the problem space\\nwithin a few agencies in the public sector. User research\\nwas conducted over seven months, with over 100 users\\nfrom 40 operational units across four government ministries,\\nto understand their respective operations, work processes\\nand challenges. Research methods included user interviews,\\nfocus groups, in-situ observations, ideation methods and\\ndesign critiques. The research informed three key persons\\ninvolved in the management of large-scale events: Decision\\nMaker, Coordinating Officer and Ground Officer. To facilitate\\ndeeper conversations with the users and stakeholders, several\\nversions of C3 prototypes were created in varying fidelity and\\nshared with them for their feedback.\\n\\nDiscovering and Defining the Problem\\nSpace\\n\\nSome of the key opportunities and insights gained from the\\nuser research were as follows:\\n\\n(1) No Access to C3 When Needed As Users Were Always\\non the Move - Many of the C3 systems were housed only\\n\\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\x0c(2)\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nin operation centres at different locations. Users had to\\nvisit these operation centres and log in to terminals before\\nthey could access the C3 systems. This hindered users\\nwho were frequently on the move.\\n\\nUsers Rely on WhatsApp and Emails — A number of users\\ndid not have access to the C3 systems. Yet, they were still\\ncalled on to contribute to the operations, and they had to\\nrely on personal applications like WhatsApp and emails.\\nHowever, WhatsApp was not designed for C3 operations,\\nand users often became lost in the large volume of\\nmessages. Sensemaking and locating relevant information\\nbecame a major challenge in large-scale missions where\\nmultiple groups and agencies had to work together. The\\nchallenge was exacerbated by having to port information\\nover to multiple applications.\"},\n",

There was no single integrated\\nsystem that could be used.\\n\\n(4) Disparate Systems in Peace Time and Crisis Means\\nMore Training is Required to Prevent Deskilling -\\nAlthough users do not necessarily need to manage large-\\nscale events frequently, they still needed to manage daily\\noperations that required coordination and collaboration\\nwith different parties. Should an incident escalate into a\\nmajor event, these users would be required to be familiar\\nwith their systems in order to respond quickly to the\\nevent. However, users have various systems with different\\noperating procedures for different types of scenarios.\\nThis led to frequent training to familiarise themselves with\\nsystems to prevent deskilling.\\n\\nDeveloping and Delivering the Proposed\\nSolution\\n\\nSeveral versions of the prototypes were created through the\\nthe key screens designed for the core functions.\\n\\n8 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\x0cNURTURING A DESIGN INNOVATION AND USER EXPERIENCE CULTURE IN DSTA\\n\\n\\nThe prototype went through many iterations with the various\\nagencies on multiple tracks of design and development. Every\\nnew insight from each iteration contributed to the product\\nimprovement. Based on insights gained, the team designed a\\ngeneric C3 system that achieved the following goals:\\n\\n(1) Integrated C3 System - As mentioned earlier, users\\nacross agencies did not have access to C3 systems when\\nthey needed to respond to incidents, and when they did,\\nthey had to work with disparate systems. Having a single\\nintegrated C3 system fundamentally transformed the way\\nagencies collaborated with one another by breaking down\\noperational silos.\\n\\n(2) Significantly Quicken End-to-end Response Time\\n- Using multiple systems slowed down response time\\nbecause information had to be duplicated and transferred\\nacross systems. All parties now accessed and worked\\non the same system and used a common source of\\ninformation without having to rely on personal applications\\nlike WhatsApp or emails.\\n\\n(3) Scalable and Minimise Waste - With a generic C3\\nplatform, the development teams would not need to\\nrecreate the same features repeatedly in C3 systems for\\neach agency. Instead, they could build on the generic\\nplatform to develop bespoke functions by creating the\\ndedicated applications required by different agencies. This\\nhelped to streamline and minimise the overall effort.\\n\\nTo demonstrate how the solution worked, the team created a\\nvideo storyboard depicting a counter-terrorism scenario and\\nhow users should use the system to respond to the incident.\\nBefore the video production started, the team created scripts\\nfrom the concept video.\\n\\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\n9\\n\\x0cUser Feedback\\n\\nThe video was presented to various user groups to obtain\\nfeedback on improvements, and specific applications that\\nthey would need. The users were better able to articulate their\\nneeds because they understood how they would coordinate\\nwith other agencies, and the specific apps they would need to\\nfill any operational gaps.\\n\\nThe users were encouraged by the design and could see\\nthe value of the system. Others were excited by the new\\n\\n10 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\ncapabilities and potential use cases that they could apply to\\ntheir own agencies.\\n\\nThe system went on trial during Singapore’s National Day\\nParade in 2019, and has since been adapted as a baseline for\\n\\nother C3 systems.\\n\\nSystem at a glance.\\n\\n\\n\\x0cNURTURING A DESIGN INNOVATION AND USER EXPERIENCE CULTURE IN DSTA\\n\\nCONCLUSION'},\n",

These OT systems are\\ncommonly found in the transport, energy, water and defence\\n\\nMany may not be aware that OT systems are present in\\nour everyday lives and drive the way we function and work.\\nHowever, these systems are not designed with cybersecurity\\nin mind, as the focus is on functionality and availability. This\\nmakes them attractive targets of cyberattacks, which can\\ncause high mission impact, bring disruption to lives and result\\nin financial losses. One of the most significant attacks was\\nthe Stuxnet event, a cyberattack which caused physical and\\nirreversible damage to the centrifuges in lran’s nuclear plants.\\n\\n\\n12 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\x0cRecognising the increasing use of cyber means to disrupt OT\\nsystems, DSTA embarked on a journey to develop an approach\\nto address the new needs brought about by the convergence\\nof the Information Technology (IT) and OT spaces to achieve\\nnew capabilities and productivity. The two key enablers to\\nsecure OT were identified to be architecture standardisation\\nand competency development. In the defence context, OT\\ncomprises control systems on ships or aircraft, data links and\\nbuilding control systems. The focus of this article is on building\\ncontrol systems, which are becoming increasingly digitalised\\nwith remote monitoring and control capabilities. The article\\naims to describe DSTA’s journey in developing the two key\\nenablers, as well as identifying future efforts and priorities.\\n\\nWHAT ARE INDUSTRIAL CONTROL\\nSYSTEMS?\\n\\nAn Industrial Control System (ICS) is a subset of OT systems.\\nIt is a combination of control components (e.g. electrical,\\nmechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic) that act together to facilitate\\ndetection and maintain control of physical operations through\\ndata acquisition, visualisation and controls. They play a critical\\n\\nrole in maintaining continuous operations, as well as ensuring\\nfunctional and technical safety in the prevention of accidents\\nand disasters.\\n\\nICS includes Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\\n(SCADA)! systems, Distributed Control Systems?, and other\\ncontrol system configurations such as Programmable Logic\\nand connectivity of an ICS. They are typically deployed for\\nmonitoring and/or the control of building related services\\ndistribution such as power, water and fuel, cooling, mechanised\\nequipment and physical security.\"},\n",

The sensors will interpret the readings and report\\nback a change of state. Actuators are used to execute the\\ncontrols via a change of contact point (ON or OFF state).\\nPLCs are embedded devices that are pre-programmed with\\nalgorithms known as ladder logic. The role of the PLC is to\\ncompare the inputs received from the sensors against a pre-\\n\\n\\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\n13\\n\\x0cset threshold. When there are deviations, the PLC will issue the\\nnecessary control signals to the actuators to bring the system\\nback to the ideal state. The PLC is also the interface with the IT\\nserver, and will be able to receive overriding commands from\\nthe server to change the pre-set threshold. Remote Terminal\\nUnits are used to interface multiple PLCs to the server, and\\nhandle the interface and translation of ICS protocols, for\\nexample Serial to Ethernet.\\n\\nInterface (HMI), servers and networking equipment to monitor\\nand control the entire ICS system. The HMI is generally the\\npresents information to the operator. The HMI may also accept\\ncontrol instructions from the operator and sends it to the\\nserver for processing. The ICS servers will poll the status of\\nthe systems periodically and present the information on the\\nHMI workstation. It will also receive the control instructions\\nfrom the HMI and send the commands to the field device to\\nactivate the control process. The Historian is the database that\\nkeeps tracks of all systems status and commands for fault\\ntroubleshooting purposes.\\n\\nEVOLUTION OF INDUSTRIAL\\nCONTROL SYSTEMS\\n\\nEarly versions of ICS started with little automation and\\ndigitalisation. Many of the control and monitoring functions\\nused to be done locally with hard-wired relays and timers\\ncoupled with man-in-the-loop processes. As time progressed,\\nthe push for automation and enhacement to productivity led to\\nthe development of remote monitoring and control capabilities.\\n\\nWhen these systems and capabilities were developed in the\\n1970s, they were based on an air-gapped and standalone\\nconcepts, with vendor or Original Equipment Manufacturer\\nspecific components and protocols. The focus of the ICS\\ndeveloper and users then was on availability and safety, with\\nscant consideration for security. In fact, the main security\\nfeature was physical security, by keeping these devices behind\\nlocked gates and security guards. This has been the industry\\npractice for the last 30 years.\\n\\nIn the early 2000s, ICS started to shift from the use of\\nproprietary computing and communications to adopting\\ncommon industrial standards and open protocols which made\\nthem more “IT-like”. Yet, the mindset on how these systems\\nwere used and designed did not change. Engineering teams\\nmanaging these systems had little or no security awareness and\\n\\n14 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\ncontinued to rely on standalone designs and physical access\\ncontrol measures to protect these systems.

This resulted\\nin fundamental security gaps and resulted in several critical\\nICS becoming targets of cyberattacks.\\n\\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE\\n\\nThe Stuxnet malware attack which damaged the centrifuges\\nin lran’s nuclear plants in 2010 was a significant event and\\ndemonstrated how a cyberattack could wreak havoc on ICS,\\nresulting in the severe degradation of a strategic national\\ncapability. Since then, there have been multiple attacks over\\nthe last decade targetting ICS, with the aim of disrupting\\nessential civilian services and lives.\\n\\nThe December 2015 Ukraine power grid cyberattack,\\nwhere attackers gained control of the SCADA and remotely\\nswitched off the substations, resulted in power outages for\\nroughly 230,000 consumers in Ukraine. It was a wake-up\\ncall for critical infrastructure operators, as networked SCADA\\nsystems were already widely in use to control and monitor\\nshowed the sophistication and determination of advanced\\npersistent threat actors, who had carefully planned their attack\\nin a stealthy and targeted manner. Using stolen credentials\\nto gain remote access, changing the passwords to maintain\\naccess and overwriting firmware of critical devices to deny\\nremote access, the attackers disrupted the power supply to\\nresidents for up to six hours in various parts of Ukraine. More\\nimportantly, remote access to the substations and breakers\\nwas denied for months, forcing electric grid operators to open\\nand close the breakers manually, while engineers struggled to\\nrestore remote management capabilities on the compromised\\nPLCs. The attack emphasised the importance of securing\\ncritical infrastructure, and demonstrated that threats were real\\nand credible, and would significantly affect businesses and\\nday-to-day livelihoods.\\n\\nMore recently, in 2021, the ransomware attack on the Colonial\\nPipeline in the United States again demonstrated how valuable\\n(as a target) and vulnerable (as a system) critical infrastructure\\nsystems are. This was not a sophisticated attack yet it still\\nforced the gas pipelines running from Texas to New York to\\nbe shut down, resulting in fuel shortages at airports and gas\\nstations. Attackers were able to gain access to the corporate\\nnetwork through a legacy virtual private network used by\\n\\x0cOPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITY ROADMAP: ARCHITECTURE AND COMPETENCY AS KEY ENABLERS\\n\\nemployees to connect remotely into the company’s computer\\nnetwork, and this demonstrated how the convergence of IT and\\nOT had enlarged the possible attack vectors into OT networks.\\nHence, there is a need to ensure that cybersecurity measures\\nfor ICS evolve with the introduction of new IT capabilites and\\ntheir corresponding threats.\\n\\nIMPETUS TO DEVELOP ICS\\nCYBERSECURITY\\n\\nWhat used to be standalone and physically isolated ICS\\nimplementation, with a flat network architecture, minimal IT\\nsecurity controls, and heavy reliance on physical controls, will\\nno longer be viable in an increasingly digitalised world. Yet,\\nthe distributed and proprietary ICS industry was not evolving\\nfast enough and effectively to cater to the new operational\\nparadigm. This resulted in the introduction of terms such as\\n“the convergence of Information Technology and Operational\\nTechnology” and “Physical-Digital Convergence”. A robust\\nsolution requires more than implementing standard IT controls\\nwith the vain hope that ICS systems would automatically be\\nwell protected and remain functional.'},\n",

A safety critical system that was first considered was\\nthe fire alarm systems. Fire alarm systems consist of sensors\\nand simple PLCs, as their primary role is to sound an alarm\\nduring a fire outbreak to alert building occupants or a central\\noperations centre. While they are increasingly integrated into\\nBAS to alert operators, fire alarm systems are meant to operate\\nautomonously with little interaction and reliance on IT systems.\\nHence, in the proposed architecture, the team decided to set\\nthem up as standalone systems.\\n\\nFor the more digitalised systems, such as physical security\\nand BAS, the challenge was to virtualise them and yet be\\nable to ensure logical segmentation to limit the propagation of\\ncyberattacks across different sub-systems.

The team worked closely with the ICS vendors\\nto implement this concept for over 20 systems, in many\\nother camps and systems. The systems were tested to be\\n\\x0cOPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITY ROADMAP: ARCHITECTURE AND COMPETENCY AS KEY ENABLERS\\n\\noperational, and vulnerability assessments were conducted to\\nvalidate the security implementation.\\n\\nHaving a large number of standalone systems also resulted\\nin huge maintenance efforts to maintain their cybersecurity\\nposture. The man-effort required to patch 50 standalone\\nnetworks consisting of different equipment types, operating\\nsystems and applications would take around 90 days. The team\\nvalidated that this effort could be reduced by three-fold to one\\nmonth by implementing a common infrastructure management\\nsystem. Setting up a common infrastructure management\\nsystem was also necessary to enable operators to manage\\nthe more complex consolidated IT and OT infrastructure with\\ntechnology and automation. The automated tools were able to\\nfacilitate IT asset visibilty and collection of security logs.\\n\\nThere were internal debates about the pitfalls of a standalone\\nversus centralised solution. The inhererent risks of cascading\\nfailures and reduction in systems resiliency in a centralised\\ninfrastructure were fully recognised.

As high temperatures can cause Li-ion cell\\nprotection mechanisms to break down, this can lead to a\\ndomino effect, where the high heat induces similar reactions\\nin neighbouring cells in a self-sustaining pattern; hence the\\nterm “runaway”. The result is uncontrolled burning, high\\ntemperatures, and venting of gases from the battery, which\\ncan happen on a very short time scale. Thermal runaway by\\nvarious root causes are elaborated below.\\n\\nFormation of Dendrites\\n\\nDendrites are solid lithium metal “spikes” that grow from the\\nanode over many charging and discharging cycles. This is part\\nof the naturally occurring aging process and thus far cannot\\nbe completely eliminated. Dendrites naturally form a sharp\\ntip, and as they grow, can eventually pierce the separator,\\nleading to a short circuit between the Cathode and Anode\\nof the Li-ion battery. The growth of dendrites is accelerated\\nby various factors such as over-charging, exceeding the\\noperational voltage limits, or using cells beyond the\\nmanufacturer-stipulated number of charge cycles. This can be\\nmitigated to some extent (but not completely eradicated) by\\na comprehensive system of battery monitoring designed into\\nthe battery charger or the monitoring component of the battery\\nmodule, and observing the manufacturer’s recommended\\ncharge-discharge and maintenance cycle.\\n\\n22 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\nNanyang Technological University has invented a new\\nbattery component that can be used as an “anti-short layer”\\nto overcome short circuits induced by dendrites, and this\\ncan potentially reduce the occurrence of this hazard when\\nincorporated into the battery (Ang, 2021). This technology is\\ncurrently being patented and commercialised.\\n\\nCharging of Over-Discharged Battery\\n\\nAll cells (including lead-acid and nickel-based batteries) will\\nself-discharge? when left in storage. When a Li-ion cell is stored\\nfor prolonged periods below the minimum operating voltage,\\ncopper shunts may form between the electrodes, leading to\\na direct short-circuit when charging is attempted. This root\\ncause can be mitigated by observing the manufacturer’s\\nrecommended charge-discharge and maintenance cycle.\\n\\nInternal Over-Temperature\\n\\nAll cells will generate some amount of internal Joule heating\\nduring charge and discharge because of internal resistance.\\nResultant temperatures above the melting point of the\\nseparator will lead to its failure, and hence create a short circuit\\nbetween the Cathode and Anode. Cooling features that can be\\nimplemented include air gaps between cells to minimise self-\\nheating and provide adequate dissipation, or heat resistant\\nlayers to provide insulation.\\n\\nExternal Heating\\n\\nAll batteries are designed to operate within a manufacturer-\\nstipulated range of operating temperatures. When a cell is\\nutilised outside its intended operating range, a self-reinforcing\\nheating cycle (i.e. thermal runaway) may be induced. Heating\\nthe cell above the melting point of the separator will induce\\nfires due to an internal short-circuit. Users should be mindful\\nto incorporate a battery that is designed to operate in the\\nintended environment and installation location (away from any\\nheat source).\\n\\nMechanical Abuse'},\n",

The selection of reputable\\nmanufacturers of battery systems is currently the only means\\nto circumvent this, as there will be stringent quality controls\\nand sampling checks done by these manufacturers.\\n\\nIt is hence crucial that all Li-ion batteries are designed,\\nmanufactured and tested adequately to ensure safety.

Even slow leaks\\nover long periods of time can let enough water in for this to\\nhappen. This can be mitigated by incorporating watertight\\nbulkheads within the UW system, although this might not be\\npractical for small, compact systems, nor would it help if the\\nbattery module itself has a leak (in the event of a collision or\\npoor waterproofing).\\n\\nWater Leakage Sensors\\n\\nPlacement of water sensors in the battery module will help to\\ndetect the presence of water. The detection of water ingress will\\ngenerate an alarm to alert users. Water sensors are preferably\\nplaced at the lowest possible location in the battery module,\\nas water tends to accumulate in such areas, giving users more\\nreaction time.

This air volume also represents the enclosed space in\\nwhich gases can accumulate (known as the residual volume).\\nThe residual volume within the system depends on the system\\ndesign, final orientation, and the position of the leak (where\\nwater is entering the compartment).

With the\\nadvancement of computer technology, older software tools\\nhad to be upgraded to avoid obsolescence and the result was\\nthe development of a new fragmentation assessment software\\nnamed MAESD that consolidates the functions and strengths\\nof each preceding software tool.\\n\\nFRAGMENTATION\\n\\nFragmentation warheads are usually designed as thick metal\\ncasings, also known as shells, packed with high explosives.\\nUpon initiation of the explosive payload, the explosive\\npresssures within the shells/metal casings expand and\\neventually break the casing into numerous fragments, each\\n\\x0cpossessing energy to potentially incapitate the targets that\\nthey can reach.\\n\\nThe lethality of the warhead would thus depend on the\\nwarhead fragmentation characteristics such as fragmentation\\ndistribution, fragment shape, mass and velocity. These can be\\nobtained from static fragmentation distribution tests known as\\nArena Tests. However, warheads are usually delivered over a\\ncertain distance, and thus lethality is also dependent on the\\nwarhead terminal conditions such as warhead velocity, angle\\n\\n(2) US Damage Criteria - A study was conducted on human\\nproxies to establish a relationship between personnel\\nperforming certain tactical roles (i.e. Assault, Defence\\nand Supply) against specified time durations (e.g. 30\\nseconds, 5 minutes, half a day) before they succumb to\\ninjuries sustained from fragmentation effects. Results were\\nthen translated into equations and constants for each of\\nthe role-duration combination, which are then applied to\\nfragmentation analyses on personnel.\\n\\n\\nThese parameters are used to determine each fragment’s\\ntrajectory by considering resultant fragment velocities\\n(i.e. speed and direction) and air drag. With knowledge of\\nfragment mass, speed and the direction they are headed\\ntowards, assessments can be done to see if the fragments are\\neffective against the intended targets. Thereafter, depending\\non the type of target, different equations and considerations\\nare applied to analyse if fragments are indeed hazardous or\\neffective. These include:\\n\\n(1) Energy Criteria - Similar to assessing injuries from a\\nbaseball impact (blunt trauma), there are standards and\\nliterature that propose a spectrum of injuries based on\\nimpact energies.\\n\\n(3) Thor Penetration Equations - These are derived based\\non empirical data from trials that provide a deeper level of\\nassessment on effects of steel fragments against different\\nthicknesses of various materials. These are applicable for\\nnon-personnel targets only.\\n\\nEARLY FORMS OF FRAGMENT\\nLETHALITY ASSESSMENT\\n\\nIn the early years, engineering assessments were mainly\\nfocused on how well the warhead was able to neutralise the\\ntarget and/or the safety distance required when training in\\nproximity.

However, computers then were not as advanced and\\n\\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\n31\\n\\x0cthe generation of results to assess performance or safety\\ncould take up to several hours or days. Hence, performance\\nand safety simulations and calculations were to be executed\\nseparately, incurring more time and effort. The following\\ntools, namely Mean Area of Effectiveness (MAE), CONTOUR\\nand FLAP3D, and the different scenarios they were each\\nused for.\\n\\nMAE was designed for near field effects on personnel targets\\nin an area at ground level. Near field trajectory analysis\\nfocuses on fragments that are directed towards the ground\\nupon warhead detonation. As fragments have high initial\\nvelocities, those directed to the ground are less affected by\\nair drag and gravity, and thus were assumed to have linear\\nusing the US Damage criterion. MAE is typically used for\\nwarhead performance assessments where the interest is on\\nwarhead effectiveness against personnel targets that are in\\nclose proximity to the warhead’s detonation point. As MAE\\nis mostly used for analysing terminal effects, at the end of a\\nflight trajectory, the required angle of fall input is limited to\\ndownward pointing angles only rather than an upward pointing\\nwarhead at launch.\\n\\n\\n32 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\nTo assess for safety distances, CONTOUR used similar\\nmethods as MAE (i.e. fragment trajectory tracking) but\\nit also considers fragments with parabolic trajectories in\\naddition to linear trajectories. For safety considerations,\\nthe threshold of probability of personnel incapacitation can\\nbe as low as one in a million, as opposed to only one in a\\nhundred for MAE calculations. In order to do so, there is a\\nneed to examine the trajectories of fragments that are not\\n3). Other than assessments on personnel, CONTOUR is also\\nable to simulate the fragments hitting metal plates of various\\nthicknesses which are used as proxies for vehicular platforms.\\nCONTOUR was also the only software that allows for warhead\\ndispersion considerations, such as probable errors in range\\nand dispersion, to be included in the assessment. Unlike MAE,\\nCONTOUR allows upward pointing warhead angles to allow for\\nsimulations of warheads exploding during different phases of\\nits flight trajectory. An example of using CONTOUR is illustrated\\n(probably due to a defective fuze that prematurely initiatied the\\nwarhead moments after launching) were simulated and clearly\\nshowed that most fragments would be directed forward and\\naway from the firing position where personnel are located.\\n\\n\\x0cEVOLUTION OF DSTA’S FRAGMENTATION LETHALITY ASSESSMENT\\n\\n\\nFLAP8D is similar to CONTOUR in terms of tracking\\nfragment trajectories, but unlike CONTOUR that handles\\ntwo-dimensional targets on the ground, FLAP8D is designed\\nfor three-dimensional targets anywhere in space such as air\\ntargets or even humans in elevated structures, such as fifth\\n\\n\\nMAE3D\\n\\nWith the improvement of computer technology, computational\\ntimelines have shifted from days to minutes. At the same time,\\noperating systems (OS) such as MS Windows were evolving\\nquickly and soon there was a concern that the software would\\nnot be able to run on newer OSs. The team then embarked\\non converting the software using modern coding languages\\nsuch as C++, and was able to combine all three software into\\na one-stop fragmentation assessment tool. The one-stop tool\\nwas named MAESD as it combined the best features from\\nits three software predecessors.

The main assumption for such studies was that the trees\\nwould be thick enough to stop any fragments.

Sound trials were conducted to validate noise mitigation measures related to atmospheric conditions\\nthat were employed by Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, USA and to explore other possible mitigation measures by\\nadjusting ammunition-related parameters. Analyses of past year local atmospheric data and sound trials were conducted\\nto quantify the effects of atmospheric parameters on sound propagation.

Wind is\\nmoving air caused by air pressure differences. When sound\\nwaves move through air, sound waves follow the direction\\nof the wind.\\n\\nThe vertical wind gradient is defined as the rate of change\\nof horizontal wind speed against the altitude above ground\\nlevel. Vertical wind gradients cause sound to refract\\nupwards or downwards (Wright, 1994). Stronger winds at\\nhigher altitudes and weaker winds at lower altitudes will\\ncreate a positive wind gradient and thus cause sound to\\ndownwind of a sound source to hear louder sounds\\ndue to the summation of the primary and the refracted\\nsoundwaves. Conversely, weaker winds at higher altitudes\\nand strong winds at lower altitudes will cause sound to\\nbend upwards and away from the ground.\\n\\nLarger differences in wind speed across altitudes also\\ncontribute to greater vertical wind gradients and thus\\nintensify the refraction of sound either towards or away\\nfrom the ground (Wright, 1994).\\n\\n\\n(2) Wind Direction - Since sound propagates through the\\nair, the wind direction affects the propagation of sound\\nby refracting the soundwaves towards the direction of\\nthe wind.\\n\\n(3\\n\\nTemperature Inversion - Temperature inversion is the\\nphenomenon that occurs when the normal air temperature\\ngradient in the atmosphere is reversed (Naval Air Weapons\\nStation China Lake, 2013). Air temperature typically\\ndecreases with height as the sun heats up the ground,\\n\\nwhich heats the air directly above it first. This occurs most\\noften on clear nights when the ground cools off rapidly by\\nradiation. In the mornings following these clear nights, the\\ncold ground temporarily keeps the air at lower altitude at\\nresulting in temperature inversion. This layer of warm air\\nforms a boundary which traps air pollutants and reflects\\nsound waves downwards back to the ground (Parnell,\\n2015), causing the soundwaves to travel further and be\\nheard over larger distances.\\n\\ntemperature inversion\\n\\nKey Ammunition-Related Parameters That\\nAffect Sound Propagation\\n\\nThe ammunition-related parameters of interest are as follows:\\n(1) Net Explosive Quantity\\n(2)\\n(3)\\n(4)\\n6)\\n\\n5) Detonation pit layout\\n\\nCased versus uncased ammunition\\nDetonation method\\nHazard Division\\n\\n(1) Net Explosive Quantity (NEQ) - An ammunition with a\\nlarger NEQ will produce higher blast overpressure (higher\\nsound level) as compared to one with a smaller NEQ.'},\n",

The trial results showed that the\\n155mm artillery shell produced about 50% to 65% lower\\nblast overpressure compared to a bare charge of equivalent\\nNEQ.

This\\n\\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\n41\\n\\x0ccould have been a significant contributing factor that\\nresulted in the excessive sound produced.\\n\\n(3) Detonation Method - Three methods of detonation are\\nof interest in this study, namely surface, sub-surface, and\\noverburden. For surface detonation, ammunition are placed\\non bare ground and detonated. Sub-surface detonation\\nrequires pits to be dug beforehand for placement of\\nammunition in the pits. Overburden detonation requires pits\\nto be dug, placement of ammunition in the pits, followed by\\ncovering of the pit with soil before detonation.\\n\\n(4) Hazard Division (HD) - Ammunition are classified\\ninto different HDs. It was postulated that the blast\\noverpressure generated could vary for different HDs\\ngiven the same NEQ.\\n\\n(5) Detonation Pit Layout - It was hypothesised that a single\\npit of 200kg NEQ will produce a higher blast overpressure\\nas compared to two pits of 100kg NEQ each. This could\\nbe due to the separation distance between the pits, slight\\ndifference in detonation timing due to varying detonation\\ncord lengths as well as the cancellation of some of the\\nsound waves due to wave interference from the two\\nsound sources.\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY OF TECHNICAL\\nSTUDY\\n\\nConduct of Sound Trial to Validate\\nEffectiveness of Atmospheric Criteria and\\nAmmunition-Related Parameters\\n\\nAtmospheric Conditions\\n\\nThe trials were conducted to validate the set of atmospheric\\ncriteria and quantify the effects of atmospheric parameters on\\nsound propagation.\\n\\nThere are however challenges faced in relying solely on\\natmospheric conditions as the only means of sound mitigation\\nto determine if live firing activities can proceed. The allowable\\ntime window for live firing activities is between 10am to 6pm.\\nHowever, data for the atmospheric parameters of interest used\\nto determine the atmospheric condition across the day are\\nonly available twice daily at 8am and 8pm when meteorological\\nballoons are released by Meteorological Service Singapore.\\nThere is a risk of atmospheric conditions changing during the\\nperiod between 8am and 8pm.

This will impact operations and training as the\\ndetonation will have to be postponed until another slot for live\\nfiring activities is available.\\n\\nAmmunition-related Parameters\\n\\nIt is therefore important to also explore ammunition-related\\nnoise mitigation measures to be less reliant on favourable\\natmospheric conditions, so that noise mitigation can be\\ntailored for live firing configurations during seasons with\\ngenerally unfavourable atmospheric conditions. Hence, sound\\ntrials were also designed to explore and quantify the effects\\nof ammunition-related parameters on detonation sound levels.\\n\\nData Visualisation and Analysis\\n\\nA data visualisation tool was used to visualise the sound data\\nfor ease of gleaning insights into the effects of atmospheric\\nand ammunition-related parameters. Analysis of the data and\\ntrial results will enable the implementation of suitable noise\\nmitigation measures for live firing activities conducted on\\nthe island.\\n\\nSOUND TRIAL\\nDesign of Sound Trial\\n\\nOne sound meter was placed at the source of the sound which\\nis on the island where the detonations take place, and another\\nwas placed at the sound receiver on mainland Singapore.\\nSentosa was chosen as the location for the sound receiver\\nas it is the nearest residential area to the island where the\\ndetonations take place.\\n\\nSet of Atmospheric Criteria\\n\\nTo continue with live firing activities and proceed with sound\\ntrials while maintaining an acceptable level of noise that will\\nnot raise public concerns, a set of atmospheric criteria was\\ndevised to determine whether live firing activities should\\nproceed or not. The set of atmospheric criteria consists of\\nrestrictions in terms of (1) wind gradient, (2) wind speed, and\\n(3) wind direction.\\n\\x0cThe criteria were adapted from the criteria used by Naval Air\\nWeapons Station (USA) to our local context after reviewing past\\nyear local atmospheric data. Since literature studies indicate\\nthat the likelihood of occurrence of temperature inversion is low\\nduring summer and from late morning onwards due to warm\\nconditions (Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, 2013), it\\nis assessed that temperature inversion can be omitted from\\nthe atmospheric criteria considering our local weather and that\\nusual live firing activities’ start from 10am onwards.\\n\\nTo validate the atmospheric criteria, a preliminary trial was\\nconducted from August to September 2019. The highest\\ndetonation sound recorded during this period at 92.4dB on\\nmainland Singapore was attributed to a considerably large NEQ\\nunder near unfavourable atmospheric conditions with medium\\nwind blowing towards Singapore and negative wind gradient.\\n92.4dB is more than 20dB below the public annoyance\\nthreshold of 115dB, which translates to the sound being four\\ntimes softer. It was thus validated that the atmospheric criteria\\nare adequate to address concerns of detonation sounds.\\n\\nCalibration Blow\\n\\nIn the event of unfavourable atmospheric conditions, live\\nfiring activities and sound trials would have to be cancelled\\nand ammunition would be brought back from the island to\\nmainland Singapore. This will impact operations and training.\\nFurthermore, sound trials will not be able to take place in the\\nevent of unfavourable atmospheric conditions, as the range of\\natmospheric conditions suitable for data collection is limited.\\n\\nS/N Trial Objective\\n\\nMANAGEMENT OF NOISE FROM LIVE FIRING ACTIVITIES\\n\\nIn order to continue with the live firing activities and proceed\\nwith sound trials to collect data during unfavourable\\natmospheric conditions, calibration blows were conducted\\nwhen atmospheric conditions were unfavourable to assess if\\nthe live firing activities and sound trials can proceed.'},\n",

The\\npurpose is to anticipate and break the transmission cycle\\nby isolating the close contacts. Forward contact tracing\\nlooks at the activities of infected person three to five days\\nbefore the onset of symptoms until the person is admitted\\nto hospital/community care facility (CCF) for isolation, as\\nthe infected person could already be transmitting the virus\\nbefore experiencing any symptoms.\\n\\x0cOn the other hand, backward contact tracing focuses on\\nestablishing the source of infection and identifying clusters. It\\naims to remove the source of transmission and prevent further\\ninfection. For example, a restaurant may have asymptomatic\\nstaff who are unaware that they were infected and continue\\nto infect others while working. Through backward contact\\ntracing, such locations are identified for further investigation\\nto establish the source of infection. Backward contact tracing\\nlooks at the activities of the person up to 14 days prior to the\\nonset of symptoms.\\n\\nThis article focuses on backward contact tracing as the team’s\\nwork centred on identifying sources and clusters of infection\\nfor epidemiology investigations.\\n\\nBesides the challenge of analysing the large amount of\\ninformation, some of the data in the activity maps were in\\nfree text and there was a need to search through and analyse\\nthis information efficiently. There was also a need to visualise\\ngeospatially where the potential COVID-19 hotspots were.\\n\\nThese challenges drove the requirement to digitise the process\\nand incorporate data analytics which could elucidate the\\ninteractions among the thousands of cases more efficiently.\\n\\n\\nCHALLENGES IN BACKWARD\\nCONTACT TRACING\\n\\nInitially, backward contact tracing was done by a team of\\nepidemiology officers who would run through the \"activity\\nmaps\" of the infected cases, and try to correlate multiple\\nbranches of information across the different cases to establish\\nlinkages. Before being tested positive, each patient could\\ntypically have up to 100 close contacts and visited more than\\n30 locations over the 14 days.\\n\\nThis process was manual and memory-intensive. The rapidly\\nincreasing cases in the early stages of the pandemic worsened\\nthe problem, as there was a surge in the amount of data to be\\nanalysed, making this manual process unmanageable.\\n\\nTHE BACKWARD CONTACT\\nTRACING TOOLKIT\\n\\nOverview of the Toolkit\\n\\nThe challenges identified in backward contact tracing were\\nmulti-faceted and required a multi-pronged approach to handle\\nthe operational needs.

It\\naccelerated the speed of development. An example was when\\noverlapping data requirements for different analysis required\\nby the epidemiology teams were quickly sieved out which\\nreduced the duplication of efforts.

Agile\\ndevelopment was practised in order to keep pace with the\\nchanging environment. Once a certain feature of the tool\\nwas ready, it was deployed immediately to complement\\nthe existing contact tracing workflow in order to get early\\nfeedback.

The TSCK was to serve as the first layer in the\\ntemperature screening process, for subjects to be flagged as\\npotentially febrile for subsequent confirmation of a fever with\\na clinical thermometer.\\n\\nDesign thinking was applied throughout the development\\nprocess to ensure that the system’s design goals were met.\\nThe first prototypes were developed within two weeks, and\\nconsisted primarily of infrared sensors sensitive specifically\\nto the range of temperatures between 30-40°C, with visual\\n\\nThe prototypes had to be calibrated so that they could detect\\npotentially febrile persons. To calibrate the prototypes, data\\ncollection for febrile and non-febrile subjects was necessary.\\nWhile data collection was ongoing, the team also deployed\\nthe prototypes at public areas, such as MRT stations and bus\\nto observe whether the system design was intuitive to first-time\\nusers and to gather valuable feedback on the product design.\\nSome of the feedback pointed to the light-emitting diode (LED)\\nindicators being too small and not prominent enough; while\\nothers highlighted that they would want to see a temperature\\nreadout. It was observed that people tended to stand too\\nclose to the TSCK, as they were used to commercial handheld\\ninfrared thermometers, which had an operational range of\\nfive centimetres. Hardware and software changes based on\\nthe feedback and observations were implemented iteratively\\nin the improved versions of the prototypes. For example, a\\nproximity sensor was included in the final system design to\\nenable temperature readings only when users were standing\\nat a correct distance from the sensor. This reduced user error\\nwhen taking temperature measurements.\\n\\nNote: Feedback for the device on the left in was in the form of a LED light bar while feedback for the device on the right in was in the form of a\\ncoloured display as well as words indicating if the user had a fever or not.\\n\\nReprinted with permission from The Singapore Army (left image)\\n\\nDSTA HORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\n61\\n\\x0cApart from being user-friendly, it was also important for the\\nTSCK to maintain its accuracy, repeatability over different\\nambient conditions and temperature stability over time. For\\none of the prototypes, a proprietary solution was engineered\\nand implemented to ensure that the TSCK could maintain its\\ntemperature reading stably without the need for a blackbody\\nreference heat source at different pre-set temperatures to verify\\nthe system’s accuracy and stability over an extended period of\\ntime.

However, this is not easily measured, unless an\\ninvasive catheter is inserted. Therefore, other body sites are\\ntypically used as proxies to assess human core temperature\\n(American Society for Testing and Materials, 2003). There\\nare four common methods for the measurement of the core\\nbody temperature (McCallum & Higgins, 2012): (1) rectal\\nthermometer, (2) oral thermometer, (3) ear thermometer, and\\n(4) axillary (armpit) temperature. Methods 1 to 3 provide\\naccurate measurements of the core body temperature, while\\n\\n62 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\nmethod 4 is an unreliable site (Sund-Levander & Grodzinsky,\\n2009) for estimating core body temperature due to the\\nabsence of main blood vessels around the area. However, all\\nfour methods require contact with the body. For contactless\\nmeans, measurements of the skin temperature are primarily\\nused as a gauge of core body temperature.\\n\\nEmpirical data collected has shown that there is no independent\\ncorrelation between skin temperature and the core body\\ntemperature of a person. Skin temperatures are also found to\\nbe easily affected by ambient conditions (Liu, Wang, Liu & Di,\\n2013) and fluctuate across different times of the day (Morf &\\nSchibler, 2013), with the highest at between 4pm to 6pm and\\nlowest in the early morning.\\n\\nAs the TSCK was a newly-designed system, there was a need\\nto determine the most suitable temperature threshold for fever\\nas measured by the TSCK. While the Infrared Fever Screening\\nSystem (IFss) had collected data during its development\\nin 2003, these were not applicable to the TSCK for two\\nreasons. First, as the TSCK used a different infrared sensor\\nfrom the IFss, it was therefore important to collect fresh data\\nto characterise the TSCK’s sensors accurately and ensure its\\nefficacy. Second, the TSCK was meant for individual use and,\\nhence, had a much shorter measuring distance compared\\nto the IFss used for screening larger groups at a further\\ndistance. The team adopted a data-driven approach, using\\nthe methodology published in the Society of Photo-Optical\\nInstrumentation Engineers proceedings (Tan, Teo, Ong & Tan,\\n2004) from the development of the IFss, to collect temperature\\nmeasurements from both healthy and febrile populations and\\nestablish the threshold at which to detect febrile persons.\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY FOR THRESHOLD\\nSETTING\\n\\nThe threshold setting of the TSCK is the level that is used to\\nindicate to the user if they might have a fever. The aim was\\nto derive a linear classifier to categorise a subject undergoing\\nscreening into either a febrile or healthy class based on the\\nsubject’s skin temperature, while minimising the impact of\\nerrors. There are two types of errors: Type | error - a false\\npositive result in which a healthy subject is classified as febrile;\\nand Type Il error - a false negative result in which a febrile\\nsubject is classified as healthy.\\n\\nTwo sets of data are required to determine the threshold setting:\\n(1) the core and skin temperature of a healthy population,\\nand (2) the core and skin temperature of a febrile population.\\n\\x0cA JOURNEY OF INNOVATION - DEVELOPING A ROBUST AND ACCURATE TEMPERATURE SELF-CHECK KIOSK'},\n",

A febrile subject is defined as\\nhaving a core temperature of equal to or more than 38°C.\\n\\nThe data collected was then plotted to understand the\\ndistribution of skin temperature of healthy and_ febrile\\nthe healthy population and the red curve represents the febrile\\npopulation. The black line in the plot represents the threshold\\nthat was being defined based on the data collected. The blue\\nshaded area in the curve represents the false positive errors,\\nwhich means healthy subjects were being misclassified as\\nfebrile subjects. The pink shaded area represents the false\\nnegative errors, which means febrile subjects were being\\nmisclassified as healthy subjects. The threshold setting was\\ntherefore a trade-off between the proportion of false positive\\nand false negative errors. For example, if the black line was\\nshifted to the left, the false negative percentage would decrease\\nwhile the false positive percentage increased. In the ideal\\nscenario, the two sets of data would have minimal overlap,\\nsuch that the shaded blue and pink regions could be minimised\\nwith a given threshold. In reality, however, the two sets of data\\nhad significant overlap, thus making it impossible to reduce\\neither the false positive or false negative without increasing the\\nother. Given that false negative was less desirable compared\\nto false positive, the threshold for the TSCK was optimised for\\nan acceptable ratio of false negative to false positive errors,\\nbased on risk tolerance level and deployment scenario.\\n\\nNote: The data points are generalised and smoothened into a curve\\nfor illustration.\\n\\n\\nProcess of Data Collection\\n\\nFebrile data collection trials were conducted in medical\\nfacilities, including hospital and private clinics, to collect the\\n6-8 for the data collection process. The TSCK prototypes\\nwere set up in similar air-conditioned environments. The core\\ntemperature of each patient would first be measured using the\\nclinic’s tympanic thermometer. For measurement consistency,\\nthe same tympanic thermometer was used throughout the trial.\\nThe patient was then directed to the prototypes to measure\\nhis/her skin temperature. Visual markers were placed on the\\nfloor and on the prototype to guide the patients on where\\nto stand and use the prototype.

The prototypes were set up in\\nair-conditioned environments similar to those used for febrile\\ndata collection. The core temperature of each subject was\\nmeasured using a tympanic thermometer, followed by his or\\nher skin temperature using the prototypes.\\n\\n\\nSetting the Threshold Temperature\\n\\nA non-parametric distribution fitting (histogram) was used to\\ndetermine the threshold temperature as the febrile patient data\\nused to assess the threshold setting of a prototype. The vertical\\nblack dotted line represents the threshold setting. In these\\nparticular examples, a threshold setting at 33.8°C would give a\\n48.3% false positive and 5.0% false negative while a threshold\\nsetting of 34.6°C would result in a 1.9% false positive and a\\n27.5% false negative.

The article looks\\n\\nacross\\n\\n2 DSTAHORIZONS | 2021/2022\\n\\nat the importance of DI and UX and its applications in the\\norganisation and the design of an integrated Command,\\nControl and Communication System. In ‘Operational\\nTechnology Capability Roadmap: Architecture and\\nCompetency as Key Enablers’, the authors share the\\napproach and capability development journey in developing\\nsafe and secured operational technology systems for\\nMINDEF and the SAF. The article also outlines future work\\nto be undertaken for further development in this area.\\n\\n‘Safety Design Considerations on Lithium Batteries\\nUse in Underwater Systems’ highlights the challenges in\\nmanaging the safety of lithium battery use in underwater\\nsystems. It discusses the characteristics of lithium\\nbatteries, safety management approaches and how safety\\nis addressed in the design of lithium battery-powered\\nunderwater systems using a system safety approach of\\nhazard identification and mitigations.\\n\\x0c‘Evolution of DSTA’s’ Fragmentation Lethality\\nAssessment’ offers insights into DSTA’s fragment lethality\\nassessment capability, and studies how advances in\\ncomputer technology as well as digitalisation can further\\nenhance this capability; while ‘Management of Noise from\\nLive Firing Activities’ studies the key factors that affect\\npropagation of detonation sounds from live firing activities.\\nIt also touches on literature research, trials conducted,\\nas well as the analysis and recommendations for noise\\nmitigation measures.\\n\\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit Singapore, a Contact\\nTracing Centre was established and contact tracing was\\nadopted as one of the national strategies to curb the spread\\nof the virus. ‘Digitising Backward Contact Tracing’\\ncaptures the DSTA team’s experiences and considerations\\nin delivering the Network Analysis Tool to help identify\\n\\nclusters and sources of infection. As fever is one of the\\nsymptoms for those potentially infected with COVID-19,\\n‘A Journey of Innovation - Developing a Robust and\\nAccurate Temperature Self-Check Kiosk’ outlines how\\nDSTA worked with various industry partners to develop\\nthe Temperature Self-Check Kiosk to allow individuals to\\nconduct temperature checks easily.\\n\\nBeyond the sharing of knowledge and insights to foster\\na culture of learning within the defence technology\\ncommunity, we hope DSTA Horizons will serve to inspire\\nfuture generations of engineers and scientists to delve\\ndeep into various fields of technology for defence and\\nbeyond.

Even if the incident was under the jurisdiction of one specific agency, people from various departments would have to work together. There was no single integrated system that could be used.\"},\\n{\"question\": \"Why is more training required for users of disparate systems?\", \"answer\": \"Although users do not necessarily need to manage large-scale events frequently, they still needed to manage daily operations that required coordination and collaboration with different parties. Should an incident escalate into a major event, these users would be required to be familiar with their systems in order to respond quickly to the event. However, users have various systems with different operating procedures for different types of scenarios. This led to frequent training to familiarize themselves with systems to prevent deskilling.\"},\\n{\"question\": \"What goals did the team aim to achieve with the generic C3 system?\", \"answer\": \"The team aimed to achieve the following goals with the generic C3 system: (1) Integrated C3 System - Users across agencies did not have access to C3 systems when they needed to respond to incidents, and when they did, they had to work with disparate systems. Having a single integrated C3 system fundamentally transformed the way agencies collaborated with one another by breaking down operational silos. (2) Significantly Quicken End-to-end Response Time - Using multiple systems slowed down response time because information had to be duplicated and transferred across systems. All parties now accessed and worked on the same system and used a common source of information without having to rely on personal applications like WhatsApp or emails. (3) Scalable and Minimize Waste - With a generic C3 platform, the development teams would not need to recreate the same features repeatedly in C3 systems for each agency. Instead, they could build on the generic platform to develop bespoke functions by creating the dedicated applications required by different agencies. This helped to streamline and minimize the overall effort.\"},\\n{\"question\": \"How did the team demonstrate how the solution worked?\", \"answer\": \"To demonstrate how the solution worked, the team created a video storyboard depicting a counter-terrorism scenario and how users should use the system to respond to the incident. Before the video production started, the team created scripts from the concept video.\"},\\n{\"question\": \"What did the users provide feedback on?\", \"answer\": \"The video was presented to various user groups to obtain feedback on improvements and specific applications that they would need.
